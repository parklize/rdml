__label__5 , what is Gmail i heard of email obvisouly but what is Gmail?,,The other answers were pretty good. Here are the things they left out:\nGet Gmail invites from this site http://www.bytetest.com/ ( it's completely automated; click and you're at the Gmail sign-up page )\n\nWhat's so good about Gmail:\n1. You've got a huge amount of storage for your email: almost 3 GB\n2. You can use Google Docs and Spreadseets (web based word editor and excel spreadsheets )\n3. You can create your own web site with localized downloads ( 100 MB ) and tons of features.\n4. You can use Google Reader (  web based rss, xml, atom.. reader ); it's better than most desktop applications ( keyboard shortcuts ... and lots of features )\n5. You can use their calendar.....\n6. A lot of other things (all free)\n7. You don't need to switch right away; create your account see how it works; and switch when you feel comfortable (like me)

This effectively creates a peanut monopoly, as it is not economically feasible to grow peanuts on only one acre (4,000 m²) of land, while drastically increasing prices.

In most cases, you can save your credit, but you most likely will lose the house.\n\nSo, you have to ask yourself what is more important?  Depending on the state you live in, foreclosure can be done in 4-6 weeks.  So, you have to get your head out of the sand and come to grips that a train is coming at you.\n\nIf you are in a state that takes longer, you should seriously think about selling even at a reduced price.  Some money is better than none.\n\nHave you talked with your mortgage company?  If your circumstances have changed and you are now able to pay the monthly note, they may restructure and put the payments on the back end of the loan.\n\nWhere are you located?

The third day I knew it wasnt going to work out. 2 problems: the commute is too far and I feel very uncomfortable when I go to work. I feel like i am about to give a huge speech to a lot of peole.

__label__2 , Radiator holds 12 quarts. 8 quarts of water, 4 quarts of antifreeze. How do I get 50% mixtue? Two part answer.,,First, pour the eight quarts of water from the eight quart container into the radiator.  Then, pour the four quarts of anti-freeze from the four quart container into the now empty eight quart container.  Empty enough water from the radiator to continue filling the eight quart container, there will be four quarts left in the radiator, but the eight quart container will contain a 50% mixture.  Finally, empty the remaining four quarts of water from the radiator into the now empty four quart container, then pour the eight quarts of 50% mixture into the radiator.\n\nNow, you still need to put in four quarts of 50% mixture.  Pour the four quarts of water that is left into the eight quart container, then add another four quarts to make it a 50% mixture again, and mix well.  Pour half of that mixture into the radiator and you now have twelve quarts of 50% mixture in the radiator and four quarts of 50% mixture left over.

__label__9 , Should I tell or just mind my business?,I just found out several years ago off and on from 98-04 my friend named Pat husband attempted to seduce to one of our close mutual friends named Kelly. Until yesterday Kelly never told anyone. Kelly didn't want  to tell Pat because of all the drama this may bring out, so she just stop calling Pat and stays away from her.  Because Pat's husband uses those times to make his move.  I am so shocked because I always thought of him a really good guy.  But I have to say I do believe Kelly's story about Pat's husband.  There have been alot of things going on that makes more sense now. I am not sure now that I know what should I do. Should I tell Pat about her husband or should I mind my business.  All of this may back fire on me if I do tell (alot of drama), but as a friend it may back fire if I dont tell when she found out that I knew about it all along.   What should I do?,I am one that likes to mind his own business on stuff like that.  These things have a way of coming out anyway.  Plus if you tell, things have a way of making you look like the bad guy and you are only trying to help.
__label__4 , How do you talk more interestingly?,(please, no little kids answer this question)This sounds like a stupid question, but how do you put more pizzaz in the way you speak? For example, i look at one girl and she has the most to say, but no one is interested in what she is saying because she sounds boring in the way she speaks, she as the same boring tone and  facial expressions.....But yet i look at this other girl and she says a few simple things, but yet it is INTeresting because she has PIZZAZ in the way she speaks! How do i talk more interestingly so i can say few words and people will be fine with it?,I am that dull person with no expression in real life, although I can open up when I feel like it. \n\nWe quiet types like to examine other people alot. If I am listening to a conversation to which I have nothing to add, then often I just zone out and stop listening, and I start examining facial expressions and body language of people around the group.\n\nOne thing I notive is that if you want people to listen to you, eyes are of key importance. Eyes can show a full range of emotion all by themselves. If you want proof go see a Blue Man Group peformance. They never speak, and never move their faces at all. They let their eyes tell the story, and the effect is fantastic. Do the same in coversation. Open your eyes wide, and look interested in what you have to say!\n\nBe confident, and smile. Jokes add colour to your words, but don't tell the wrong joke to the wrong audience. \n\nUsing your hands to emphasize your expression can be a good tool, but don't overdo it. An example of overdoing it would be using your fingers as little puppets to act out everything you're saying (that may seem a bit extreme, but I know someone like that).

You should notice a steep curve on the graph like an exponential graph.\n\nThe log2 (x) means 2^(what power?)=(your x input)\n\nFor example, if you have x as 1, you will get -2+0=-2 for y\n                                 if x is 4, you get -2+2=0 for y\n                                 if x is 8, you get -2+3=1 for y

__label__6 , Are the Division Formats fair in  MLB ?,AL East and AL Central have 5 times , AL West 4 teams . \nNL East and West have 5 teams , NL Central 6 ! \n\nIf you were a team in the NL Central wouldnt you be complaining ; asking Bud Selig . Hey how come they (AL West)only have to beat 3 teams to win their division while we have to beat 5 !?,I would agree that there is a certain unfairness about having different-sized divisions, for the reasons you stated.  However, both the AL and NL have to have a even number of teams for scheduling purposes.  If things were evened out and both leagues had 15 - 3 divisions of 5 - then either there would have to be an interleague game every day, instead of at certain periods of the year, or one team in each league would have to be idle for a day or more likely 3 days at a stretch - the equivalent of scheduling a series against a null team.\n\nThe only ways to fix it would be to either go back to the old divisional set up - two 8-team divisions in the NL and two 7-team divisions in the AL, or expand the AL by two teams, so that both leagues have 16, and go to four 4-team divisions.

I paid him 6 days ago and we were supposed to move in today. He has not been in touch since. when we paid him, he issued us a temporary receipt. It was a mistake to trust him but anyone got a suggestion on wat to do abt this? shall i make a police report?,Who is this guy?  The owner of the building?  The property manager?  The super?  A  current tenant who is subletting?\n\nWhere is this studio?  In NYC?  Did you go by the property?  If so, was it vacant?\n\nWhat you do depends on answers to those questions.  The police aren't going to help you just because someone isn't answering their phone.  You need to find out what this persons authority is as far as renting out the studio, and proceed from there.\n\nAnd if you signed a rental agreement, then you have the right to move in. Go pick the lock and move in :)    Don't ever do this.  There are people out there who rent apartments that are not theirs to rent, and being scammed won't stop you from being arrested, especially in NYC.  You will be in jail for 3 days before you get a chance to tell your side of the story and even then they may not let you out.

Those who want to prove that their religion is superior don't know the first thing about religion.\nOrganized religions should try to be servants of humanity, not masters.\nChristians say their massiah was God's only son; Jews say they are God's chosen people; Muslims say that their prophet was God's last prophet and all in thier Holy book is the final deal...I am sure Hindus and Buddhists also have some way or other to claim superiority....its all bovine excreta...\nJust refuse to accept superiority of any organized religion over rest of humaniry...

__label__4 , What is the best way to to skip a grade?,I really want to skip a grade but I don't know what I have to do to make it happen. I have really good grades in all my subjects. I don't think I have anything lower than a 95. I've been tested for gifted and the results come back just slightly above average but what I dont understand is that everytime a take a different test such as the FCAT which is the statewide test or the SRI (Scholastic Reading Inventory) tests, I always score about three grades above what the average student should score to be on grade level. I don't think you have to be in gifted to skip a grade though. I've only gone to public school for 1 year so far and this is my second so in case that has anything to do with it. So anyone who knows please help!!!,It's very different from school to school, I'd suggest talking to your guidance counselor and parents about why and if you should skip a grade. Skipping a grade isn't just about you being smart, you also need to be able to make up all of that work and knowledge that you're going to miss. Especially in subjects like Math, where you constantly build on previous knowledge, skipping grades can be a fairly bad idea.\n\nIf, after careful thought, you still want to go through with it, then the only way would be through asking someone in your administration, probably a guidance counselor or a dean perhaps. Usually they don't allow people to skip grades unless you're below high school, but even if you are at the high school level there is still the possibility of graduating early.

__label__4 , enzymes+ biology?,Using your knowledge of enzyme structure and function, can anyone please explain to me why a prolonged period of high fever is dangerous to humans?,Enzymes are proteins, and high temperatures cause them to denature (a process that results in the shape of the protein changing).  The shape and structure of an enzyme are vital to its ability to bind with a substrate, so once the enzyme is denatured, it will no longer be able to function.\n\nA prolonged fever could raise body temperatures high enough to denature enzymes.  Since enzymes are important for many body activities (without enzymes many chemical reactions in the body would not occur at all, occur very slowly, or result in different products) such as digestion, denaturation of many of the body's enzymes could be dangerous.  \n\nFor more information on enzymes...\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme

There is no common denominator in the type of food I am eating.\n\n I would say that the majority of the time I consume a couple of\n\nalcoholic beverages but that could be wine, beer or mixed drinks. \n\nThis occurs in smoking as well as non-smoking restaurants.  These\n\nsneezing attacks do not occur at home, even if I have a drink so I do\n\nnot believe it to be the alchohol.

Try not leaving the restaurant.  Try hiding in one of the bathroom stalls until all the employees leave for the evening and then crash on one of the booths.

__label__10 , Previous drug use?,When I was a youth, I have experimented with several drugs. I  haven't done drugs in years and I'm interested in becoming a police officer.  I was told that if you have used drugs in the past, you cannont become a police officer.  Is that correct?,Hey, I am a Police Officer and have been for the last 19 years.\n\nPast drug usage will not stop you from becoming a Police Officer.  As long as you disclose your usage when asked, you will be fine.  If you have any in your past, they will find out during the background check.  So, just be honest.  If you have any further questions, e-mail me and I will help if I can.  \n\nGood luck.

__label__1 , does one go to hell if..........?,thay cannot forgive or reconcile with their parents?\n\nat d old students re-union i was surprised at the number of women who had a grudge against their mothers and the number who men who blamed their parents for their misery. \n\nthere was a woman who felt that her parents had squashed all her dreams when they paid for her brother's medical education. they had no money left for her, so she had to work for a living just after high school. the brother has moved on and now she has to look after her parents single handedly. she is glad she has them, but always wishes that they had paid for her education. as as kid she always wanted to give them a big house and happiness.\n\nthen there were people whose parents had seperated when they were small. they never had a parent, and have not been able to forgive the parent that brought them up for creating the vaccum in their lives. \n\nthe question is: with so  much bitterness against their parents, will they ever be able to make it to heaven??,John Milton, in Paradise Lost said, The mind is its own place and in itself can make a Hell of Heaven, a Heaven of Hell.  Thus, we create our own destiny anew in each and every moment.  Bitterness is a thorn deep below the skin of our consciousness that continues to fester as long as we harbor it.  To be free, one must let go of the past and take responsibility for their feelings and their actions.  It is irresponsible to blame one's feelings on another.  Where do the feelings emanate from?  Within ourselves, we create them.  Something outside may be the catalyst for such feelings, but we create them and react to our self-made feelings.  \n     I have a question for your question - why wait until you are dead to find out?  Why not try to be free from our self-created suffering and live in peace right this second?\n\n  As the maxim goes:  To err is human.  To forgive, divine.

__label__2 , when is friction produced?,,Friction occurs anytime there is resistance when two objects touch.  \n\nThe rougher the texture of an object, the more friction it can produce.  All the little tiny rough spots catch on each other (imagine running your hand over, say, a piece of sandpaper...you can feel the grains of sand catching at your hand; it's a lot different than running your hand over something smooth, like polished metal)  The rough surfaces catch at each other and stick together.  That's friction.\n\nFriction is the reason we can walk on the ground - otherwise, we'd slip and slide everywhere, as if we were on ice.  (Really, really slippery ice :p)\nFor another example, when you're driving down the road, friction between your tires and the road is what keeps your wheels rolling along.  \nIf you hit a patch of ice, and your wheels slip, it's because there's not enough friction to overcome the force of your wheels turning.  Ice is slippery - there's less friction between tires and ice than tires and the paved road.

And how does it cause these? Thanks for any help!,Excessive body weight has been shown to predispose to various diseases such as \n - cardiovascular disease, \n - diabetes mellitus type 2, \n - sleep apnea \n - osteoarthritis.\n - kidney stones\n - congestive heart failure, \n - enlarged heart and its associated arrhythmias and dizziness\n - varicose veins\n - pulmonary embolism\n - infertility\n - hernia,\n - colorectal cancer\n - gall stones\n - incontinence\n - cancer in general esp, breast, uterine and prostate  \n - still births\n - gout\n - stroke\n - carpal tunnel syndrome\n - dementia\n - asthma\n - too many psychological defects to mention e.g. depression and body dysmorphic disorder\n\n\n..... and this is only the short list!\n\nObestity is linked to each in a different way. In general heart conditions occur due to the increased work load and pressure obesity causes. Joint problems occur due to an excess of weight.  In artherosclorosis, the fat actually sets off the cascade for the thrombis formation and further ischemia and blockages that follow.\n\nYou really need to be specific in this area as it is so large! Research into each disease will give you a better idea.\n\nThe lesson here is obesity is a bad thing! It is correlated with such horrible diseases, why would you put yourself through it?
__label__10 , verbal agreement between two individuals, cat and bird missing from home-theft?,A family goes on vacation. Made a verbal agreement with a boy who would take care of animals while family is gone. The boy had the key to the familys home. He was supposed to feed and water bird and cat at the familys home and was to keep the dog at his house until the family got back. When the family did get back, the dog was gone, taken to a dog pound. The bird and the cat are missing out of the familys home. Would this constitute as unlawful entry and theft?,No because the boy was authorized to care for the bird and cat.  It is not unlawful entry and theft.  He was careless.  You may sue, but you did employ someone underage to do an adult's job.

__label__6 , what is the measurement of the tennis yard?,,laying Lines:\nThe outside dimensions of the playing lines should be as follows:\nDoubles 36' x 78' (10.97m x 23.77m)\nSingles 27' x 78' (8.23m x 23.77m)\nAll lines should be not less than 1 (2.54 cm) nor more than 2 (5 cm) in width, except the base line which  may be up to 4 (10 cm) in width and the center line which should be 2 (5 cm) in width.\nClearance Between Courts\nWhere courts are constructed within the confines of a common enclosure, the distance between side lines should be not less than 12' (3.658m). Where space permits, it is desirable to provide additional space between side lines to enhance play; 24' (7.315m) is recommended.\nTennis Court Orientation:\nA tennis court should be laid out to minimize players looking into the sun when serving or when following  the flight of a ball. A tennis court also should be laid out to avoid distracting shadow lines and patterns on the court surface.\n\nTheoretically, the best possible layout would be to orient the longitudinal axis of the court perpendicular to the azimuth of the sun -- the angular measurement of the horizontal location of the sun in relation to true north. Since the azimuth of the sun constantly shifts according to the time of day, the season of the year and the latitude in which it is observed, it is difficult to generalize about an ideal orientation.\nNOTE: It is important to remember that the orientation of the court should be in relation to true  north, not to magnetic north. The angular difference between true north and magnetic north is  referred to as the deviation of magnetic north. This deviation changes according to the  geographic location. Information relating to the deviation of magnetic north from true north can be easily obtained from a local surveyor or airport facility.

__label__4 , could anybody give me a presentation about job interview?,i have a presentation about job interview so iwant small presentation that i can offer it in 10 minutes,INTERVIEW TIPS\nThese pages are designed to provide you with some useful tips so that you can maximise your success through the application and interview process.\nWhilst this is only a guideline, it is often the simplest of things, which can make the difference between securing the job you want, and being rejected as a possible candidate.\n\nBE PREPARED\n\nIt is often the simple and most obvious things, which can make the difference between securing or losing your ideal job offer. Before the interview there are several things that you can do to give you the leading edge over other applicants. A positive attitude is essential to convince the employer to offer you that lucrative position. \nHere are some helpful hints.\nResearch\nResearch the company in as much detail as you can. Visit the company websites for more detailed information and request a copy of their Annual Report. You can also contact your consultant who will have expert knowledge of the client, the environment you'll be working in, the company culture as well as the employer's expectations and candidate requirements. Take advantage of their experience and they will help you secure your ideal role. \nIt is important to find out specific facts about the company:\n•What its products and services are?\n•What is its growth potential for the future?\n•Who are their main competitors?\n•How are they viewed in the market place?\nThere are a number of research applications providing this information. Among the most helpful are:\n•The company's annual reports\n•Kompass \n•Textline \n•The Stock Exchange Research Handbook \n•The Internet/Company websites \nEnsure that you are up to speed with the facts and figures of your present/former employer. You will be expected to know a lot of information about the company you have previously worked for. \nPresentation\nFirst impressions count. Ensure that you wear your smartest suit and act in a professional manner throughout the interview. A company is more likely to hire somebody who is well presented as they will be future representatives of their company. \nPunctuality\nEnsure that you know the exact time and location of the interview. Your recruitment consultant will provide you with a contact name and also a map of how to get there if required. Allow plenty of time in case of travel delays. \n\nDURING THE INTERVIEW\nInterview Do's \n•Introduce yourself courteously\n•Arrive on time or earlier if possible \n•Express yourself clearly \n•Smile during the interview \n•Show how your experience can benefit the company \n•Ask questions concerning the company for which you are being interviewed for\n•Construct your answers carefully\n•Show willingness to learn and progress \n•Be assertive without being aggressive \n•Switch your mobile off during the interview!\n•Prepare 10 relevant questions, you'll probably cover 5 in the interview \nInterview Don'ts \n•Don't be late for the interview \n•Don't be unprepared for the interview \n•Don't answer questions with a Yes or No. Expand whenever possible \n•Don't lie. Answer all questions truthfully and honestly\n•Don't overemphasise money. Do not discuss salary in the 1st interview unless they do; getting the job at this stage is the main priority - salary negotiations will follow \n•Don't say negative things about previous employers\n•Don't show lack of career planning \nFor every responsibility/requirement on the job specification, ensure you have at least one example of an experience or a transferable skill that covers that requirement for the interview.\nTypical Employer Questions:\nEnsure that you know the exact time and location of the interview. Your recruitment consultant will provide you with a contact name and also a map of how to get there if required. Allow plenty of time in case of travel delays. \nQ: Tell me about yourself?

__label__1 , Who knows and can explain the religion that is based on love and not selfish ambition? 10 points for the best.,there is only one i hate to call it religion cause its not its the heart. but i want to hear if people can comprehend it like i do.,Love God, love others as you would yourself. Jesus replied that to the religious leaders when they asked what is the greatest command of all. Love does not hurt, mock, gossip, judge,kill, anger or anything that would harm others. God's true intention of the law is for us to learn what hurts each other and Jesus came to fulfill it and now therefore we are under grace. If love governs our hearts, we wouldn't do anything that harm others. The perspective we should try is the motivation of love and not having the pressure to obey the law. Love fulfills those laws God loves us regardless of what we do because He looks at the heart.

We could tell they were two males, because they both had magnificent tails (the males have the larger tails than the females) ... they were obviously arguing over females or over territory, because they completely ignored us - they're usually very shy. We stood still, and they continued to chase one another and continued to cross the walking track right in front of us ... it was magical!

Active forms, which are immediately available to the body are obtained from animal products. These are known as retinoids and include retinal and retinol. Precursors, also known as provitamins, which must be converted to active forms by the body, are obtained from fruits and vegetables containing yellow, orange and dark green pigments, known as carotenoids, the most well-known being beta-carotene. For this reason, amounts of vitamin A are measured in Retinal Equivalents (RE). One RE is equivalent to 0.001mg of retinal, or 0.006mg of beta-carotene, or 3.3 International Units of vitamin A.
__label__6 , Fantasy Baseball - Esteban Loaiza start?,Should I start Esteban tomorrow vs Minnesota in a 5x5 league?,Esteban Loaiza.  He should be good for a win.  Minnesota hasn't done too great this year.  Oakland has a pretty good offence, great defence and great pitching and bullpen.\n\nLoaiza is 10-8 vs Minnesota in his career.  He has allowed 54 earned runs has 94 punch outs, and a 3.71 ERA.\n\nHe last played against Minny in 2004 whily playing for the White Sox and fared decent against them with a 1-1 record and 4.09 ERA.\n\nHe didn't play them in 2005 due to being in the NL for the Washington Nationals.\n\nIn 2003, at Minny's field, the Metrodome, he was 1-0, allowing 3 runs on 9 hits and had an ERA under 4.\n\nHowever, All time at the Metrodome, Loaiza is 3-6 with a 5.12 ERA and only 42Ks in 11 games and 58 innings pitched.\n\nAgain, however, Loaiza usually pitches his best baseball in the month of April.  He's compiled a record of 18-6.\n\nHis home-away stats are not relevant to this situation as they are pretty similar.\n\nIt's a toss-up.  I really don't see a problem from having anyone start any games, because they're usually bound to get you a few K's and potentially a win.  All public leagues don't count losses against the scoring and only ERA is affected.  Being early in the season, most pitchers are giving up a lot of runs.\n\nGood luck.\nCraig

Don't give me that crap about this country being started by immigrants, that was plenty long ago for it to have no bearing these days.  Either live here as an American, speak our language and do as Americans do, or pack your belongings and get the hell out!

__label__4 , How do u turn a # like 2 into a %?,,You would multiply 2 by 100 to make it a per cent so it would be 200%.  If the number was .2, you multiply that by 100 and you would get 20%.  If the number was .02, you x 100 = 2%.\n\nIf the number was 1/4, you still multiply by 100, and get 100/4 which would be 25%.\n\nI hope this helps.
__label__2 , In the medical field what is a D.O.?,,a doctor of osteopathic medicine\n\nOsteopathy is a system of therapy founded in the 19th century based on the concept that the body can formulate its own remedies against diseases when the body is in a normal structural relationship, has a normal environment and enjoys good nutrition.\n\nAn MD (Medical Doctor) goes to a School of Medicine, and a DO (Doctor of Osteopathy) goes to an Osteopathic\nSchool of Medicine.\n\n\nFor a longer Answer:\n\nFrom Ohio State University's School of Medicine -\n\nMD or DO - Is There A Difference?\nA medical doctor (MD) and a doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO) generally have the same educational background. Both are required to complete an undergraduate degree -- usually with an emphasis on science -- followed by four years of medical school, and then a residency program. The length of this residency program varies by the physician's specialty. All physicians must then pass state licensure requirements and examinations.\n\nIn regard to primary care, the basic difference between these two types of doctors is narrowing all the time. The biggest difference is that most DOs go into primary care, according to Bryan Beggin, DO, of the OSU Family Practice Center at Gahanna. The philosophic difference is that the DO tends to treat the entire individual, rather than using\na disease-specific approach to treatment.
__label__10 , -----War-----?,What is it good for?,The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. -- Edmund Burke \n\nWar is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things.  The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling that thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse.  The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. -- John Stuart Mill \n\nLet every nation know, weather it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty. -John F. Kennedy
__label__1 , Whatever happened to personal responsibility?,Theres alot of questions latley pointing out the killing of women and children in the Bible, such as the flood, or the Prophecy in Isaiah.\n\nGod gave them warnings, a chance to repent, and yet people, knowing that they were acting against God, decided to ignore it. And yes, their children died, for the choices THEY made. The parents themselves, by ignoring God, brought death to themsleves and their families. \n\nGod gave them a chance, were they not personally responsible for what happened? They had an out, they didnt take it.,People ultimately are responsible for the actions they take.  We are all beings that have a mind and should be able to use it.  The problem is you are going to see those type of examples in a world where its easier to shift blame then to take the responsibility.  \n\nIt's so much easier to shift the blame saying I was abused, or this happened to me, so feel sorry for me.  In this way the person becomes a victim and the blame and responsibility is shifted to another source.  This creates an endless cycle as the blame just keeps getting shifted.  In doing so those originally responsible often get sympathy and their deeds will not seem so bad to many.\n\nPersonally, its tiring to consistently see someone push the blame away that way.  We as people are individuals and ultimately responsible to what happens to ourselves.  If you are strong enough to shirk your responsibility to others or yourself, then you should be strong enough to say, Yes, I'm responsible.  \n\nHowever this type of blame game will continue as long as society allows it to and thus is shifted to the deeds of the past.

But 4 weeks ago we got into a fight. she was irritated by me studying and only doing my homework. and not taking her out enough(i used to take her out every week on Fridays and Saturdays). she continued to bug me for 2 hours and i had enough and i told her to mind her own business about that. and she started making a huge issue out of it. i was sick and tired of it and told her to keep her fuckin* mouth shut. as soon as i said that i realized my mistake. she walked away and started crying. she even didn't come to our next class. her friends almost the whole high school girls came to me and started to scold me and abuse me. i just didn't do anything and kept quiet while my friends took care of the other girls(i don't know how this became such a big issue). but during our school trip we patched up again. i told her i loved her and she said nothing, then the next moment we were kissing. but....,people only have the ability to upset us if they mean something to us.  so, obviously, she definately loves you.  \n\nShe may be deeply hurt at the extent at which you lashed out, especially if she's never seen that side of you before. which would also add shock to the equation, by the way.\n\npersonally, I would ask for a sit-down time with her, and just get it out on the table, the what happened, the why, and the how not to let it get to that point again.\n\neven couples need time to themselves as individuals, in order to make the couple work better.\n\nhonesty, and open-minded communication- the 2 most important keys to a good relationship.  oh, and let's not forget mutual respect.\n\ngood luck.

__label__6 , pele or maradona who was the greatest?!?!?!?!?!?,,this question will never have a definite answer, it falls to personal preference...\nthere have been many great players, all of which were amazing in their own right, however it is simply impossible to determine who was the best ever due to the obvious difficulties involved with comparing players from different eras, and also the fact that many great players were so good because of unique individual attributes. For example, all the goals Pele scored may make him the best goal-scorer / finisher of all time, whereas Maradona's ability to beat 6 or 7 players on one of his mazy dribbles may make him the best dribbler of all time. some may also be better tacklers, passers, headers, goalkeepers etc. However, just as an aside, with all the dozens of names being banded about......surprising not to heard a shout out for George Best? Personally I think he was amazingly talented and should be up there on anyone's shortlist!!..i saw many videos for George Best and he was amazing...just like pele and maradona\nfor your question however i prefer pele because his character is way better than maradona's

__label__3 , Why does eating  asparagus make your urine smell funny?,,As you clearly know, the human digestive processes are typically able to break asparagus down into smelly by-products with an amazing quickness, often within 15 to 30 minutes after eating. When you use the lavatory, those odorific by-products are released as a rather pungent form of asparagus urine. \n\nThe website WebMD blames this smell on the break-up of a chemical called mercaptan. That said, asparagus contains a half-dozen sulfur-based chemicals identical ones found in other such lovely smells as rotten eggs, garlic breath and skunk spray. There is some controversy in the scientific community over exactly which by-product, or combination of by-products, causes the asparagus urine smell. The first published study on the phenomenon, written in 1891 by a man going by the name of Nencki, found that the smell was caused by a metabolite called methanethiol. So far, this conclusion seems about as sound as any.\n\nBut the story of asparagus urine is far from ending there. Some people eat asparagus, go to the restroom, and-amazingly-no smell. Further research suggested that, likely due to genetics, some people did not possess the enzymes required to create asparagus urine. Perhaps you've heard it said that a person who's pee smells after eating asparagus has high intelligence? Well, maybe there is some genetic corollary for that. (Just kidding, all you eugenicists out there!) \n\nTo complicate matters even further, however, around 1980 a scientist had the good sense to pass the urine of the non-asparagus urine population in front of the noses of the asparagus urine population, and lo-and-behold, many found they could smell that asparagus urine smell. People are now debating whether genetics controls the ability to produce asparagus urine, the ability to smell asparagus urine, or possibly both.\n\n http://www.greenworks.tv/askgreenworks/asparagus.htm

__label__7 , could savings bond be better than 401k with limited income?,,Sure if you wanted some liquidity, guarantees and as a means to compliment a more aggressive retirement strategy, i.e. save 3 times as much with a savings bond and never quit working.  Savings bonds are easier to get to, but I wouldn't necessarily put more than a few months to a couple years worth of expenses into one.  The problem with savings bonds is that over the long run they will 97% of the time not out perform a stock index.  Stocks are based on companies making more and more money each year.  Savings bonds are the gov'ts ability to print more money.  With that said, companies are still better at making profits than the gov't.

We do not take anything you say personally- and we actually pray for you. But I am curious to know the REAL reason you come here- are you hoping to find some truth about God? Or do you just believe in relegion? Why is it you come here and are so profane. It is more sad than anything- and I honestly hope and pray that your heart will be softened one day to the truth of God. Or else why would you be here?,I don't try to get Christians upset. I come hear to talk about and get peoples opinion on religion. That is why I am here. Am I so profane or is that a general statement? My heart has softened to those I think are duped into myth. I mean no disrespect. But we do have opposing opinions. \nThis is a R and S board. So the topic of R&S is discussed not necessarily promoted or agreed upon.\nAs I must work with so many believers and associate and even risk my life alongside them, I seek to understand them more. That is why I am here. Why are you here?\nBTW I like your question.

One large megaplex local to me has a hallway where people exit and if you walked in through the doors while others were exiting you'd never get caught unless someone asked you for your ticket.  They key I've found to anything shady like this though is to act like you belong there and know what you are doing.  Do that and you can accomplish almost anything.

__label__3 , If I want to loose at least 10 - 20 lbs in a month what would I have to do?,Is it even possible for someone larger to loose that much weight safely in that time frame? What do I have exercise and diet wise?,Hi Jade!\nFrom my knowledge, yes it can be done, but not really safely. Remember, the trick isn't to get skinny, but healthy. Diet pills can be very dangerous. They can cause health problems, addiction, and most trick your mind into believing your not hungry when you actually are. Starving yourself is defiantly not the answer. \nThe best thing to do is to watch out for your food portions. Follow along with the food pyramid, and incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet. Also, include exercise into your daily routine. Don't start off with anything big. I recommend Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds videos. She has different stages, from One mile up to three. They are all done inside your home and is more of an aerobics. I've been using them for a while, and am quite pleased. However, the trick is finding what fits YOU best. \nAlways remember that when you start a new exercise routine, you will more than likely gain weight. A lot of people get discouraged by this because they don't understand what it means. Your body is simply retaining more water, and it will start to pass through in a few weeks. Also, muscle weights more than fat. So if the fat is being replaced by muscle mass, then your weight will go up. Just hang in there. You'll soon start to see the scale dropping. \nThe best way to loose weight is by doing it smart. \nHope this helps, and best of luck to you!\n-Pegasus

__label__1 , Why they are so many religions, Gods, Goddesses, Gurus, and Saints in India?,,Why Do Hindus Worship Many Gods?\n\nHuman beings through history have formulated many different names and forms for the Divine or Eternal. Just as we have many names and forms for other things, whether it is foods, or types of art, so too, in religion a similar great diversity has been created.\n\nThe Western world has prided itself in monotheism, the idea that there is only One God as the highest truth. Western religions have said that only the names and forms which refer to this One God are valid but those which appear to worship another God, or a multiplicity of divinities, must be false. They have restricted the names and forms they use in religious worship, and insist that only one set is true and correct and others are wrong or unholy. \n\nAs a universal formulation Hinduism accepts all formulations of Truth. According to the universal view there is only One Reality, but it cannot be limited to a particular name or form. Though Truth is One it is also Universal, not an exclusive formulation. It is an inclusive, not an exclusive Oneness - a spiritual reality of Being - Consciousness - Bliss, which could be called God but which transcends all names. The different Gods and Goddesses of Hinduism represent various functions of this One Supreme Divinity, and are not separate Gods. \n(Having many names for something is not necessarily a sign of ignorance of its real nature. On the contrary, it may indicate an intimate knowledge of it. For example, Eskimos have forty-eight different names for snow in their language because they know snow intimately in its different variations, not because they are ignorant of the fact that all snow is only one. The many different deities of Hinduism reflect such an intimate realization of the Divine on various levels.)

However, if you need the student's L1 to explain a word or an activity, then you are trying to do something too difficult for them. The students really need to learn to use dictionaries, to negotiate meaning and to guess - itself not easy for some students. They also need to choose between these strategies sensibly. Asking the teacher or a classmate for a translation will block this process.\n\nHere are some links that may help you.  Good luck with your research.

__label__8 , Who sang that song that goes She so hi---gh.. High above me. She's so lovely? Who did the popular version?,I searched it and there's Everclear, Fastball, and Tal Bachman (whom I've never heard before). Which version is played on the radio - the most popular?,I'm thinking it's the Everclear version. They had a video when that song came out, and are the most popular band of the three, which would mean more air time.
__label__3 , what's the cure for asthma?,,There is no cure. Asthma is forever.\n\nMy brother was born with it.  He is now 56 years old. He still has it.  He and his doctors have tried every-f***ing thing out there. It doesn't go away.\n\nAll you can do is control it.\n\nKnow what triggers an attack, and avoid it.\n\nWith my brother, it's animals.  He has no pets, and doesn't spend much time at my house...I go visit him.\n\nFor me, it's tree pollen (but not flowers), cigarette smoke, and pollution/smog.  I stay indoors as much as I can during pollen season or high smog days, and call in sick if I have to. It doesn't win me any points at work, but the alternative is only managing a half-day of substandard work before I end up in the emergency room.  As to the cigarette smoke, I avoid bars and nightclubs.  Just because I don't deal well with the smoke does not give me the right to dictate other people's choices.\n\nMy other brother's asthma is triggered by flowers and perfumes.  He avoids gardens, and leaves for work earlier or later than the regular rush hours because some people feel the need to dump an entire bottle of perfume on in the mornings. You can't open the windows on the subway trains, so again, he can choose a non-standard commute time, or go to the hospital.  He's also stopped going to church because of the incense and old ladies overdoing it with perfume.\n\nIn your case, you should probably ask your doctor to do an allergy test as well.  Anything you are allergic to will also trigger an asthma attack.  Most people will not have to go to such extremes as my family does, but forewarned is forearmed.  Knowing what causes an attack will help you control the disease.

__label__2 , Why is it that insects are attracted to light?,,Many insects orient their lives with the position of the sun,\nsuch as bees.  Some insects are attracted by the heat that some\nincandescent bulbs produce at night (infrared radiation).\n \nTo really answer this question, you need to focus on an insect\ngroup or species.  They are so diverse.  Fireflies use light\nas a means to attract and find mates, for example.\n \nThe bottom line may just be as simple as saying -> you have to be\na bug to know for sure!
__label__3 , do u sleep with your retainer in?,,Probably the best time of day to wear your retainer is when you are sleeping. That way it doesn't bother you.

Teeth have a memory for a VERY long time and they will want to shift back to where they started. Good Luck!!!!

__label__1 , Why do people need a faith?,I have seen hundreds of Q & A's on here about religion. Im not attacking believers, but the people who find it necessary to tell the world why they are right and others are wrong- no matter what relaigion it is.\nReligion (not spiritualism)was invented as a political tool to control the masses, and now has become the biggest killer in history. Is it not time everybody got off their high horse and took personal responsibilty, instead of 'following' or doing a 'gods work'?,You are a little hard on the religious.  While I agree with you mostly there are mitigating reasons for belief:\n\n1.  Humans are a tribal species with an instinctive need to follow.\n2.  Ignorant people, which describes humanity up until the last 100 years or so, will believe religious doctrine no matter how ridiculous.\n3.  Humans invent and believe in gods in a desperate attempt to have some control over Mother Nature.  \n\nThe reason churches hate secularism so much is it provides answers that work without religion.  Religion is dying and they know it.

__label__7 , I need money to pay my house note, my husband has been laid off  over a year.?,,The key to financial well being is looking ahead with the right attitude.  If your hubby has been looking for a year, he probably feels like dog poop and so do you.  There is no magic solution, but you might think of selling your house and moving to an apartment, relocating to a different place or starting your own business.  Your real key to a real solution is motivation and you don't just pick that up off the street. \nFind some professional financial advice first and get some spiritual help, perhaps at your local church.  Get involved in groups.  You find jobs not in the want ads but because someone knows you and recommends you.  Be prepared to make some serious changes.  Better to sell your house and lose some than lose everything to a foreclosure.  Although it seems trite, undergoing hardship can make you stronger.  I became a bartender after being laid off from a high paying job some years ago.  It's inexpensive as education funds go and you get the money back in short order. It was only temporary, but it got the funds coming in again without losing everything. Sit down and go over the positive aspects of both your lives and see what talents you have.  You might just be looking in the wrong place.  God bless you!

__label__6 , Do you feel that the referees in the super bowl game influenced the outcome of the game?,,Well, of course, the refs influence the outcome of everygame. Even if they call a perfect game and don't make any mistakes, their calls will influence who wins the game.\n\nBut I don't see what the big deal is with the refs in the Superbowl. Overall, they did a good job. The only call that they missed was that block by Hasselback, other than that, they made all the right calls. People just want someone to blame for their team losing, unfortunately the refs are the easiest people to place the blame on. Anyways, if the refs had called a mistake-free game then the Steelers still would have won.

Answers.  Let's see if I can paint you a picture.\n\nImagine that you are in the northern ecliptic sphere looking down on the solar system.  Now imagine that there are points at the edge of the solar system like the face of a clock.  And let's put the Earth at 90 degrees (or 3 o'clock) from the Sun.\n\nMercury would be at aproximately 4:00\nVenus would be at aproximately 8:45\nEarth (we already said) is at 3:00\nMars would be at aproximately 9:15\nJupiter would be at aproximately 8:15\nSaturn would be at aproximately 11:45\nUranus would be at aproximately 4:45\nNeptune would be at aproximately 5:15\n\nHope that gives you a clear picture of the alignment currently.

__label__3 , a person who mentaly multi tasks, diagnosed as such. how can they survive in a normal thinking world?,few people truly multi task, most switch between tasks. those who really multi task have difficulty surviving in a single task world. people think they are retarded or worse. if asked to say the alphabet, they would say a then z. most people will say a-b-c--all the way to z. some true multi task people have had their children taken by the state because no one understands them or how their brain works. where can one find documentation to assist with understanding.,If, when asked to recite the alphabet, one says a followed by z and then stops, that person has not multi-tasked because the task has not been completed regardless of sequencing issues.  Multi-tasking only occurs when the given task is executed to completion.  Either your example is flawed or the assumption of multi-tasking is flawed.\n\nIn computing, multi-tasking requires a minimum of 3 processes: two processes that share the assigned work and one that supervises the functional tasks to insure that they are performed in sequence (and sequencing does matter) and monitors for completion of tasks A and B.  These processes can be assigned to three different CPUs.  While the human brain does have multiple parts, I have not heard of cognition occuring separately in the parts.\n\nIs it possible to think two distinctly different thoughts simultaneously?  My inclination is to say no, the subject is merely jumping from one thought to another and back rapidly - not truly multi-tasking.  Can you cite the basis and origin(s) of the multi-tasking diagnosis?  Would very much like to follow up on this interesting line of thought.

__label__2 , what is the possibility of 5-digit even number from 0-9 with condition the 2nd number is either 3/6/9?,0-9 form 5 digit even number the 2nd number is either 3/6/9,Assuming these are the only restrictions:\n{\n3/10 possibility (3, 6, or 9) for the 2nd digit,\n5/10 possibility (0,2,4,6,8)  for the 5th digit  \n}\nthere are 3*5=15 combinations of those successful outcomes, which is 15% of the number of all possible combinations (00-99).\n\nSince there are as many possible combinations of the other digits  (1000) for successful outcomes as for the general population (also 1000), those digits are irrelevant to determining the proportion of matches to the general population, so leading zeroes don't matter and neither do a 4 and a 2 in 3rd and 4th digits, as long as the overall population shares the restriction.  It's still 15%.\n\nHowever, the manner in which the number is chosen could be relevant for describing the probability; for example, if the number is chosen one digit at a time such that no digit can repeat itself (like a lotto), its probability of matching the desired outcome would be different.\n\n===\n\nIf the value of each digit can only be used once, the overall population size is only 10!/(10-5)! = 10!/5! = 10*9*8*7*6 = 30240.\nIf there are restrictions like no leading zeroes, then multiply by 9/10, but unless there are other rules, matches are still distributed evenly across the other 3 digits.\n\nAs long as the order digits are selected does not matter\n3/10 for digit2\n5/10 for digit5\n(8*7*6)/10 for the remaining digits1,3,4 (start at 8, since two are already taken in order to guarantee the match)\n\nso (3*5*8*7*6)/(10!/5!)  =~ 16.67%\n\nIf leading zero is not allowed, then distribution is\n[\n(8*3*7*6*1) (where digit5 is 0)\n+(7*3*7*6*4) (where digit5 is {2,4,6,8})\n] / (9*9*8*7*6)\n\n==  (8+28) / 216 = ~16.67% \n\nIf each digit is selected in order and may not be re-used, then it's more complicated.

She's not fighting so hard to say it's not true because she's trying to protect her reputation! She's sold sex since she asked the world to hit her one more time. If there wasn't a tape, she'd let the story play out since it gives her publicity...and not any publicity she isn't already familiar with, right?!! Because there's a tape, she's fighting like crazy... That would be the absolute end for her and she knows it. Her star can't hold up against any more scandal...she's no longer bullet proof in entertainment like some people are...Robert Downey, Jr., Tom Cruise (though he's hanging on by threads too), etc... Some people can withstand whatever is thrown at them - no matter how damaging, and still come out on top. Britney married K-Fed (PUHLEEEEEZ!), had two kids (she's what now - 23? 25?), and completely dissed Justin (just about the hottest male vocalist today) who is loved by millions. And then her interview with Matt Lauer - eeewwww. She might as well have shown up in overalls with a piece of straw in her mouth and a little gravy dripping down her chin. She made hillbillies look good and that's hard to do. She won't survive any more scandalous publicity. She's just not THAT innocent...
__label__1 , Can a seXy/holy meme establish itself because it contains a seXy circular self-referential argument?,The sexy/holy circular self referential argument would go something like this:\n\nX is the one true meme. We know X is the one true meme because The Source of Universal Truth (or whatever) has approved X. \nWe know The Source of Universal Truth has approved X, because X contains statements which say so. \nWe know what X says is true because X is the one true meme.,If it's dressed properly, yes it can become established.  If you put it out there in it's formal syllogistic format, you won't sell it.  Dress it up with flowery language and kill some people who doubt it every once in a while, and you grant it legitimacy.  Would that humans could always break things down logically and reject those things that don't meet the basic tenets of logical validity.  It saddens me that people are swayed by logical fallacies on a daily basis.\n\nOh, and I took that as an invitation to report abuse, so I reported you Wayknow T.  Have a nice day.

__label__2 , do emergency room doctors get paid a lot?,ER doctors seem to work really hard and they have to know everything, so do they get paid more than doctors with offices?,ER docs get paid slightly above average in comparison to other doctors.  However, they work shorter hours than most physicians and generally do not have to take call (in other words, once they are off work, they are off work).  They do not have to know everything, if you are comparing to doctors in other fields.  (All physicians have to know a little about every field, but no doctor knows everything about every field).  They just need to know how to recognize a wide variety of conditions that present in the ER, and know when to refer a patient to a specialist.\n\nThis is not to downplay the level of knowledge that ER docs have in comparison to other physicians.  ER docs often do well in their medical school class.  But there are other fields that are more competitive and are generally paid more (such as neurosurgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and orthopedic surgery)\n\nIn general, doctors working in a hospital are not paid as well as doctors in private practice.  Many, many people are treated at the hospital without health insurance (it would be unethical to turn them away).  This leaves hospitals cramped for money, so other patients' bills go up and doctors salaries go down, despite what the general public may think.\n\nAlso, when people discuss physician salaries, they often forget to factor in malpractice insurance, which has bankrupt and put many doctors out of business.  ...and yet so many people still want to sue doctors because they think they earn a lot of money.

From 1682, when King Louis XIV moved from Paris, until the royal family was forced to return to the capital in 1789, the court of Versailles was the center of power under the Ancien Régime. Those who are not French tend to call it the Palace.

A district study said it would cost an additional $62.9 million over the next 10 years, raising the cost over the decade to $148.9 million from $86 million.\n\nSupporters of the idea say it would improve working conditions and benefits for drivers, which in turn could lower driver turnover and improve services for students.\n\nBut opponents say this isn't the time to devote more money to transportation. The district has been struggling for months to save $2.5 million a year by closing seven schools.\n\nI've been opposed to it from the outset, said board member Michael DeBell, who serves on the Operations Committee along with members Mary Bass and Irene Stewart. Obviously, we're not in a position to spend significantly more money on our busing, our transportation costs. ... I believe that it's in the best interest of the district to save money wherever possible outside of classroom instruction.\n\nMost surrounding school districts provide their own bus service. Seattle contracts with Laidlaw Transportation Services and First Student.\n\nDistrict buses?\n\n\nThe Seattle School Board Operations Committee will discuss bus-service options at its meeting from 4 to 6 p.m. today at school-district headquarters, 2445 Third Ave. S. In addition to discussing the contracts with Laidlaw Transportation Services and First Student, the committee will hear a report on a pilot program that placed Ballard and Franklin high-school students on Metro buses this school year. The School Board has discussed for several years bringing yellow-bus service in-house. In 2005, three board members — Stewart, Bass and Sally Soriano — voted against the current bus contract because of concerns over wages and benefits for the 400 drivers involved. That contract expires in June. Laidlaw employs about 80 of the district's drivers, and First Student employs the remainder.\n\nSoriano said the Portland School District decreased its driver turnover to single digits by switching from contracted bus service to directly hired drivers to transport its special-education students. It's the responsibility of the board to try to improve the stability of the district's work force, she said.\n\nThe overarching issue is that the board has tried to get the drivers to have it be a stable work environment, she said.\n\nStewart and Bass, who chairs the Operations Committee, did not return calls seeking comment.\n\nLaidlaw drivers voted to join the Teamsters in May. Since then, they've been in contract negotiations. First Student drivers are not organized, though Teamsters Local 174 business agent Chuck Deaver said there's an effort under way.\n\nLaidlaw drivers are treated very well, said Betty Zaloudek-Moore, the Seattle branch manager. I think this is a very positive work environment. Our drivers work very hard.\n\nThe committee also will consider providing district-operated transportation for its special-education students. That would cost about $12 million over 10 years.\n\nI think the idea of in-housing the transportation goes beyond the treatment of the drivers, said Robert Augustin, a Laidlaw driver who has been driving Seattle district buses for eight years and supports the proposal. From the board standpoint, they think they can save some money in the long run.\n\nIf the district employed bus drivers directly, driver salaries would increase about 3

No matter what else they pretend to care about from time to time — undermining national security, aiding terrorists, oppressing the middle class, freeing violent criminals — the single most important item on the Democrats' agenda is abortion. Indeed, abortion is the one issue the Democratic Party is willing to go to war over — except in the Muslim world, which is jam-packed with prohibitions on abortion, but going to war against a Muslim nation might also serve America's national security objectives. Liberals don't care about women. They care about destroying human life. To them, 2,200 military deaths in the entire course of a war in Iraq is unconscionable, but 1.3 million aborted babies in America every year is something to celebrate.,Ann nailed it--as usual.\n\nSomeone just has to get her to come out of her shell and tell us what she really thinks about things.

I prefer to compare parties based on if they are authoritarian or freedom-loving.  Communists are among the most authoritarian, as are socialists and fascists, and many of the parties based on enforcing dogma.  Typically, the left has been composed of those groups that want to redistribute income, and to do this one must be authoritarian, such as the communists, so it is not surprising that they are called leftist.  \n\nI much prefer to see freedom and liberty.

I really don't stress on getting into biggies and a small company would be excellent to start with because you end up learning a lot of things. usually companies have an aptitude test and once you clear it they have different rounds like personal round or an HR round where they test your behavioural skills and how you react to different situations. \nThere is no limit to knowledge and you can attain loads of skills. To begin with Internet programming is what I suggest. There is a wonderful site called www.w3schools.com which teaches basic programming.\nYou can begin with HTML and then slowly move on to ASP and SQl Server and then dot net.Once you get going there is nothing stopping you. Mind you....this site just gets you started and then once you finish off with the basics there are loads of sites which help you.

__label__4 , What is a natural monopoly and why do they exist?,,A natural monopoly is one that exists because of economies of scale rather than one created by a government to fill the need.\n\nTelephone companies, cable companies, et cetera are often local monopolies give sole license to operate within a city because the cost of deploying cables or wires to the home would be cost prohibitive for multiple companies to deploy, own and operated.\n\nMicrosoft is like a natural monopoly, despite some of their practices that some deemed anti-competitive, they have had competitors for decades.  For reasons of compatibility, operability, and cost, Microsoft became, for all intents and purposes, a monopoly because the consumers chose them by the product purchases they made.  Consumers were always free to buy an Apple computer, DR-DOS, WordPerfect, and any of countless other products.  However, they didn't because there was an economy of scale by being able to exchange Word and Excel documents, buy a computer from competing manufacturers which ran the same software, and purchase software written for Windows becuase it was too costly for the developers to write software for multiple platforms.  Thus it was natural rather than being given sole license by any particular governing body such as the US Government.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly

Hopefully there are some people out there in my same situation.

__label__3 , Im a junior in highschool and I want to be a dentist, how do I do it?,what classes do I take now and in college, what does it take to join dental school,Finally - an interesting question.  People apparently don't know that they can search the previous questions instead of asking the same thing that 6 other people asked earlier in the day.\n\nStart by going to a good college so you will have a better chance of admission to a dental school.  Dental schools are becoming harder and harder to get into, so a good college helps.\n\nIt helps to look into the requirements for admission to a dental school and work backwards.  This will help you choose your college major and it might even help you choose your college.  Typically, it is easier to match up the requirements for dental school admission with the requirements of a science major and biology seems to be the closest match.  You could be a history major if you wanted to be, but then all of your electives would probably be used up trying to take courses required for dental school admission.\n\nTypically, you graduate from college with a bachelor's degree and then start dental school, which is a whole separate entity from college.  Some colleges offer combined programs where the really bright and focused student might be able to combine some credits and actually enter dental school before receiving the undergraduate degree.  \n\nObviously, you would have to know this well in advance, as it might even determine where you apply to college.  You do not have to disclose this intention as you are applying to the college, but you need to look into the program almost immediately, because it will determine quite a bit about what courses you need to take as soon as possible in college.

The only thing I can do is try to never dismiss people in my life, and to value what they say.
__label__4 , do you think that smarter people get a better life?,,Hi, I think that smart people do not necessarily have a better life. Since, they might be looked down on as being nerds- smarty pants. Additionally, smart people sometimes have a harder time being social since their always thinking with their brain. Also, it depends on what kind of smart you mean, a smart- quick witted person may have a good life getting along with people. However, all people have equally good lives, its what you make of it.

__label__2 , Should there be guidelines regarding Q&As about medical conditions discussed here?,I've only just joined Answers this week but have noticed the crazy number of people that ask questions about about medical conditions.\n\nObviously we are all just trying to be helpful but what if wrong and unfounded opinions are taken for fact? \n\nCould this be a disaster waiting to happen?,I've been thinking the same thing. Because of the wacky answers I've seen on this site, I have spent the last few on-call nights directing people to get proper treatment. \n\nI think this section is a disaster waiting to happen. It only takes one person to convince a patient to delay treatment. I've said it before it takes more than typing www.webmd to give accurate medical advice. \n\nTo the Kate person, you might think differently if your grandmother were given bad info from someone making a joke, or selling their cure-all. Freedom of information isn't always a good thing. Disease doesn't recognize democracy. Your chlorine analogy is not funny, these are real people I might have to take care of down the road when their problem has gotten worse after receiving BAD info from THIS website. Fighting medical ignorance has been difficult enough with scam artists making their home on the internet targeting the desperate, and the evening news proclaiming carbs are bad, no wait now they are good, and telling the public everything causes cancer. Of course the public is confused. THIS forum only makes it worse.\n\nI've written to Yahoo Answers about this, but haven't received a reply.
__label__1 , what's the odds of being left-handed in the world?,,About 10% of people all over the world are left-handed (Mcmanus, 2002). However, if you are wondering risks/odds, one area may be in familial sinistrality (how many family members you ahve that are left-handed).\n\nHandedness runs in families, and  even having a grandparent (who it can be argued will have be of little imitative effect) who is left-handed increases a person’s chance of being left-handed. The effects of parental sinistrality are seen below \n\n Effects of parental sinistrality (McManus, 2002)\n\nParents’ handedness (respectively)/ Percentage of left-handed children\n\nRight & Right   9.5%\nRight & Left    19.5%\nLeft & Left     26.1%\n\n\nIt is evident that children born to at least one left-handed parent are more likely than the rest of the population to be left handed.\n\nI hope that helps! all the best!

Thats not true, its not being conceided if you feel positive about yourself.  Its just like any other job.
__label__1 , The claim that God sacrificed Jesus to save us because He was Just, contradict the definition of justice?,God is Just, and justice requires that nobody should be punished for the sins of others, nor should some people be saved by punishing other people.,So can I be sorry and not belive?  Thats BS.\n\nIn defince to christians, justice is objective.  That is why so many people flipout over a judges virdicts.  And in japan it use to be common practice for a one man to serve anothers sentence.  Also think about the wipping boys from old Europe.

__label__2 , Descartes' Rule of Signs?,I do not understand Descartes' Rule of Signs, so please help.  I am not necessarily looking for the specific answer, but some direction on how to do these types of problems.\n\nUse Descartes' Rule of Signs to determine how many positive and how many negative real zeros the polynomial can have.  Then determine the possible total number of real zeros:\n\nP(x) = 2x^3 - x^2 + 4x -7\nand\nP(x) = x^8 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1,Dascartes rule of signs says that the number of positive roots of a polynomial (with real coefficients and ordered in descending powers) is equal to the number of sign changes between consecutive coefficients or is less than that by an exact multiple of 2 (since double roots are counted twice)  Negative roots are counted by changingthe signs of the coefficients of all odd powers of the variable and counting the sign changes the same as for positive roots.\n\nIn your first problem there are 3 sign changes so there are 3 positive roots (one of which may be a repeated root).  Changing the signs of the x^3 and x terms leads to no sign changes (all of the coefficients are negative) so there are no negative roots and the total is 3 roots, all positive.\n\nIn the 2'nd example, there are 6 sign changes so there are 6 positive roots.  Changing the sign of the x^5, x^3, and x terms leaves no sign changes so there are no negative roots.  Since a polynomial of order n has n roots, there are 8-6 = 2 imaginary or complex roots in the polynomial and 6 real roots (which may contain repeated roots)\n\n\nDoug

__label__4 , Is this ok for a personal statement? I'm in year 11 and applying for college soon.?,Personal Statement – Kadie Bark\n\n     My name Is Kadie Bark, I'm 15 years old and I am currently attending The Sheffield Springs Academy. I'm a friendly, kind and patient person, and I am known to be bubbly and sociable, also I find it very easy to get on with people. I have a range of skills including:\n\nNumeracy\nLiteracy\nComputers\nMy creative instincts\nI'm practical\nHard working\nDependable\nI'm a quick learner \n\nI'd say that my biggest strength was probably creative writing/writing to describe as this Is the area that I do better In and I enjoy the most.\n     My punctuality and attendance has generally been good, but over the past six months or so It has improved greatly and I aim to improve It even more.\n     I have a really good relationship with teachers and pupils. I get along with most pupils in our school and have never had any trouble In the past. I think my teachers would agree that I am a sensible student who at times can get a little distracted, but is dedicated to completing work/tasks.\n\n\n     My favourite subject In school would have to be English, as I enjoy writing, especially creative, and I love to read also. Another subject that I enjoy is Art, as I like learning new techniques and applying what I have learned to a piece of work.\n     I have been on a few school trips before, the main one being when a small group of pupils went on a trip to France, Normandy. While we were there we looked into the historical aspects of the city by visiting famous landmarks, such as the Bayeux War Cemetery. I have also taken part In school events such as the annual sports day.\n\n\n     While I was participating In work experience, my job title was 'Nursery Assistant', the tasks which I had to fulfil include watching out for the children's safety at all times, making sure they were never bored and always had something productive to do and helping them settle down If they became upset, etc. The skills I gained from this experience are valuable life skills which will come In very handy In the future. I learned how to act around children, what to do In certain situations. For example If a child was misbehaving, they would have to apologise and have a five minute time out before rejoining the other children.\n     I think my relationship with both the children and staff was great. The staff never had a problem with how I was working and at the end of my work experience they thanked me for doing such a great job. Also the children were sad to see me leave.\n     I did not actually get invited back to work at the nursery as If I was to have an official staff position there I would need to have some qualifications. And although I enjoyed my work experience, I don't think I will pursue working In a nursery as a career option. \n\n\n     When I am not at school there are a number of different things that I like to do including socialising  with friends, going to the Cinemas, going Bowling, Skating, making promotional graphics for websites, talking to friends online, moderating and posting In forums, etc.\n     I recently had a part time (Saturday) job at a hair salon, sweeping hair up, making tea, washing the customers hair, but I stepped down as I wanted to spend more time on coursework/revision.\n     My favourite pass time would probably be socializing, and talking to friends as I feel It Is very important to have a healthy social life.\n     I am also interested In books and reading. My favourite book Is Guitar Girl by Sarra Manning as I like her quick and witty style of writing. I also enjoy books from Meg Cabot as she has a similar style of writing. The books that I read are mainly teen oriented, but I do like to read other books now and again. \n\n\n     In the future I plan on going to college and taking part in a full time English Literature course and English Language course. Other courses I am interested In taking are Photography, Music, I.T and Health and Social Care.\n,Seems pretty good.  I wish you would have censored the personal info before posting.\n\nI noticed fulfill seems to be spelled wrong, is the way you have it correct for Canada/UK?\n\nWhite space also makes things easier to read.\nTry to identify some of the longer sentences and make them more bite-sized.  People read shorter sentences more thoroughly.  \n\nBe more confident in what you say.  Try seeing how any sentence with I think in it sounds if you remove that phrase.\n\nDo you have to incriminate yourself?  I know it's good to be humble, but you really should be tooting your own horn here.  Obviously you can't overinflate achievements, but don't call yourself distracted (for example).\n\nEven though I used a parenthetical statement above, don't do it in your submission.  It's kind of like saying ignore the part in parentheses.\n\nRather than saying that you haven't made a choice yet, I'd just say you are open to several career possibilities if you agree with that.\n\nBTW, everybody wants to pass their classes and be paid well, I don't know if that's worth mentioning.  \n\nWhen you look to the future, don't focus on what you can get, focus on what you hope to contribute.
__label__3 , does any body know if pollen travells through airconditioning in a house?,im allergic to it,   but im so hot locked in my house,\n i need my aircon,Yes. It depends on how good or how clean the filters are, how old the machine is, whether it's a window unit or central air, etc. And pollen can get into a house many other ways... not just through air conditioners. People bring it in on their clothing, pets bring it in, it can come through cracks in doors and windows, etc. Go ahead and use the air conditioner. It probably won't make much difference in the pollen count inside the house.

__label__3 , What happens in surgery under anesthesia?,Hi I'm going to have my wisdom teeth out. I have to go into the hospital for it. They're gonna put me under. I'm scared cause I've never been under. I've heard they strip you naked after they put you to sleep. Is  everybody gonna see my body naked? It kinda creeps me out that I will have no control over what is happening while I'm there.,No! It's against the LAW for a doctor to explore any PART of your body while you're under, that is not a required field for surgery.\n\nI'm an RN and can tell you, that a female nurse MUST be present at all times during a female patient's surgery or gynochological exam.  The same applies for dental.\n\nWhat will happen when you go to sleep is a mind blower.\nYou never, ever feel yourself falling asleep because it happens so fast.\nYou won't feel scared or have a clue as to when you fell asleep.  It happens quickly.\n\nYou'll be talking and in the middle of a sentence, you'll wake up and ask What happened?  I thought you were going to perform surgery on me.\n\nThe reply you'll get is, Sweetheart we already did it.\nYour brain enterprates that only a split second has passed.\n\nThey are going to put you to sleep with an anesthesia, we call twilight sleep.  It's mild but keeps you asleep so you don't feel any pain.  You wake up quickly from it and will be able to go home as soon as you can walk without falling down.\n\nIt has a tendancy to make you a little wobbly for about a half hour after you wake up.\n\nTrust me, you will probably get a kick out of this.  It's over before you know it and you won't have any scarey feelings.\n\nYou will however probably feel just a tiny bit of nausea(sick to your stomach) for about half an hour after waking up as well.\nThis is normal and it goes away quickly.\n\nAny jittery or nervousness you will feel, is just the anesthesia wearing off and that too passes quickly.\n\nOnce you go through this experience, you will never be frighted again.\n\nI promise.  If ANYTHING, you'll probably get a kick out of it, like I mentioned earlier.\n\nThe only thing you'll remember is feeling REALLY GREAT before it's nighty night time, which takes only seconds.

__label__1 , What do you think about New Age?,,New Age along with Buddhism is the only forms of spirituality that will survive the new world. \n\nThe way I understand it, New Age is a study of all forms of religion and spirituality. It doesn’t have a bunch of laws and regulations (even in modern Christianity the old laws of Leviticus are seen as a taboo). \n\nWell, this new form of faith has no laws and believe it or not it has no faith either, it only looks for the universal power of love and healing of the soul. \n\nSounds good to me. I think even an atheist that base their life and beliefs on facts would admit that a religion based on the unseen powers of the universe can be good.

__label__2 , Where can i get information about tundra region??,Its location,climate,Natural vegetation,Wild life e.t.c,In physical geography, tundra is an area where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term tundra comes from Kildin Sami tū̄ndra, the genitive of tundar, treeless plain, or according to some, comes from the Finnish word tunturia, also meaning treeless plain.\n\nThere are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, Antarctic tundra, and alpine tundra. In all of these types, the dominant vegetation is grasses, mosses, and lichens.\n\nTrees grow in some of the tundra. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree-line or timberline.

I typically support him as at least being sincere, but this is not only insincere, it insults our intelligence.  As an article I read pointed out, the only way additional border patrols would substantially slow illegal immigration by itself is if there were sufficient patrols to do 'Hands Across America' along our southern border.  The Senate had already put the $1.9 billion for border security into an appropriations bill, and Bush is saying it should be spent on something we all know will be a band-aid.  Initially, when I thought he was going to get additional funding above that already voted for, I was OK with this as a stop gap measure while more permanent solutions are put in place.  I am not OK with it as a stop-gap measure that will be expensive to implement, drain our border security budget, and leave nothing to show for it when the troops are ultimately removed. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/18/AR2006051801774.html

__label__3 , I bleed too heavy. What could be the causes of that?,I usually go through 60-70 super plus tampons with severe cramps.,Uterine fibroids, adenomyosis and a hormone imbalance are 3 major causes of heavy menstrual bleeding.  Given your cramping, I would suspect the first two.  You are bleeding far too much and it does need to be addressed in order to protect your health.  Treatments include medical and surgical options, like oral contraceptives, endometrial ablation and/or surgical treatment of the fibroids or adenomyosis (if they prove to be the cause).  The cure for adenomyosis is a hysterectomy, but sometimes endometrial ablation can help some women with the disorder.  A local women's clinic, Planned Parenthood or similar organization should be able to help you with diagnosis and treatment on a sliding scale basis if lack of insurance is an issue.  Good luck!
__label__6 , Why did Kobe all of a sudden decide to become a passer instead of a scorer in the playoffs?,I'm not complaining by any means because the Lakers are exceeding expectations in the playoffs. I'm just wondering how and why he came to such a decision to be just another Laker than to be Kobe Bryant. From the moment the Lakers-Suns series got started he was passing more than shooting. Why?,You can play around more in the regular season than in the playoffs. In the Playoffs, you have to play a more complete brand of basketball to win. Phil must have made it abundantly clear that if Kobe didn't get the other players involved, they wouldn't stand a chance.\n\nAlso, seeing Steve Nash win MVP could have done two things to Kobe. It could have made him think that if Nash was considered, by the majority of the voters, to be more influential in making his team win, by passing as much or more than scoring, then maybe he would too. OR it's possible that the ultra-comptetive Kobe has come out to prove that he can play a more sharing, Nash-like game better than Nash can. Or maybe he's just trying to show he can play a more balanced game, to show that he should have been voted MVP. Or maybe this is part of his attempt to clean up his image. Maybe he's trying to overcome the stigma against him that he doesn't pass, and he's doing it on a national stage where everyone can witness it.\n\nMaybe he's learning to trust his teammates. Maybe his teammates are giving him more of a reason to trust them. \n\nThe Lakers are a franchise built around Kobe at this point. Late game, he is their go to guy. He is always put in a position to win the game at the end, bring them back, or keep the lead up in close situations. Maybe it's sinking in that it's his team, and he's not feeling as pressured to prove it is. Maybe he had enough big individual scoring games this year that he feels his talent can't be called into question if he doesn't score.\n\nWho knows. Just know that Kobe's competetiveness and ego are probably the driving factors in this change, since they seem to have driven the rest of his noticeable behavior so far. Since winning is how success is measured in the Playoffs, he could satisfy his ego and competetiveness more through winning than individual performance - although one could argue that his individual performance is more impressive now, despite the decline in scoring.

__label__7 , Can a taxsheltered annuity be rolled over to an ira CD account at a bank without paying income tax ?,,It depends on the status of the tax sheltered annuity(TSA).  If the TSA is an IRA, 403(b), 401(k) or some sort of account that you took a tax deduction on your tax return the year(s) you made contributions, then you can roll it to an IRA CD at the bank. Look carefully at your statement from the TSA and see if it says IRA or 401(K) or 403(b) or qualified account close to where your name or account number is located.  If you added money to this account thru a payroll deduction plan, it probably is an account that can be rolled to the IRA CD.\nA TSA can also be what is called a non-qualified account, meaning that you put after-tax dollars into the account. These TSA accounts cannot be rolled over to a CD.\nIt is often times hard to get the TSA company or their representative to help you with you questions about moving money OUT of their company. However, the bank where you want to move the money to should have a representative that is more than willing to help you figure out how to move money TO their bank.  Take your TSA statement to the bank and ask for their help.  I disagree with the previous answer about getting help from the TSA company.

__label__1 , What do single mom's or low income families need to put themselves in a better position besides money and God?,I want do establish a faith based program to help them. Please only reply with serious answers.  Thanks,Change of attitude!  \n\nI believe that we live intentionally and our decisions  are a reflection of the beliefs we have of ourselves. \n\n I have known women who seem to attract men who are not good husband or father material--yet they choose to be with them and have babies with them.  All species are attracted to the best of their kind--the strongest, fastest etc.  It is natural to want the best traits to be passed down in your offspring.  \n\nSome women do not pick the best because they do not think they deserve the best.  \n\n  Also, I have know both men and women, who are always in dire circumstances because of their attitudes. People who have a a better opinion of themselves would be sad and frustrated in situations of bad circumstances, but would use the occasion to grow--not self-destruct.   \n\nMoney problems are not fixed with money.\n\nDr Phil and Suze Orman believe that money problems are first resolved by 'fixing' your beliefs and habbits.\n \n  Dr Phil once said that if I took all the money away from people who have it and give it to people who do not have it, within a year the people that had money taken away would have some. The people who had money given to them would lose it again.  I have witnessed this time and time again. \n\nMy advice--a mentor/education program with a strong support system. \n\nEducation is power and giving people the tools to develop their skills and make them economically viable to take better care of themselves is a tremendous gift.  Also made them aware of opportunities, so they can make a choice to take advantage of them.  \n\nThe mentor program can exposed people to possibilities beyond their wildest dreams; where there is a change of enviornment so they can pick up the influences of people who are proactive about succeeding and living a better life, not just struggling day to day.  \n\nRemember--if you give me a fish, I will eat for a day. If you teach me to fish, I will eat forever.

I posed as a homeless person wearing the traditional ragged clothing and i did not wash my hair for days to make it appear as if i had not bathed in months. Upon requesting a place to sleep and meals to eat at a local chuch i found that here is where my exlusive investigation took a turn for the worst. I was asked if i was a christian and if i had heard of the gospel of jesus I replied no and was asked if i wanted to hear the gospel and i said no. I was told i had to turn to christ or turn toward the door and start walking out of the church establishment because i had to either partake in the bible studying that i saw was going on around me or leave. And so i left. And so i ask you audience how shocked are you  as you look at my exclusive investigation? Are you shocked? Describe your reactions,That is standard procedure for Christians.  It is a corrupt business organization with no morality to speak of. They want new members any way they can.  They want to get as much money into the collection plate as possible and pretend they are doing good works for people when they really aren't.

__label__1 , Is it possible that christianity was simply an adaption of the earlier religion of Mithraism ?,The entirely unearthly Mithras was worshipped as the Good Shepherd, the Way, the Truth and the Light, and as a redeemer, saviour and Messiah. Mithras was supposed to have been born to a virgin on what is now 25 December, and was visited by shepherds and Magi. He travelled and taught, cast out devils, made miracle cures, held a last supper, was killed, buried in a rock tomb and rose again after three days, at the time of the spring equinox in March (equivalent to the Christian Easter). Mithraism included baptism and Sunday worship, with a Eucharist and sacraments. \n\nMithra's birth was witnessed by shepherds and by Magi bearing gifts to his sacred birth-cave of the Rock (J. Smith 146). Mithra's image was buried in a rock tomb, a sacred cave that represented his Mother's womb. This was ritualistically removed each year, and he was said to live again. Mithra's triumph and ascension to heaven were celebrated during the spring equinox.\n\nThe similarities are striking.,You'll be surprised by the un originality of Christianity. They absorbed many pagan beliefs, holidays and demonizing many gods (E.g. Baal and co) to convert people. It is their way to convince people that Christianity is the one religion

__label__4 , Is there a name for someone who is afraid of shrimp?,,It should be a 'kariophobe'. The Greek for shrimp is, apparently, 'karis'. (Mixing Latin and Greek is really not on, I'm sorry!) Sorry, too, Dory, yours is way too long - but it would look good in a medical report!\n\nOf course you could go for Shrimpwimp or Prawnscorner.\n\nThe tiny stuff that some whales eat by straining it through their mustaches is called 'krill' and I believe that a lot of it is tiny shrimp-like animals. 'A' is often used to denote the negative aspect of something - agnostic, for example means 'not knowing - so how about 'akrillic'?

These are all good detox herbs. They tea will taste foul but this is the most potent way to get the herbs. Drink a cup 3-5 times daily. Keep up the vitamins and electrolytes as well. \n\nAlso on the end of the index fingernail on the inside (thumb side) is the accupuncture point for the beginning of the large intestine meridian, tap here around 20 times, then on the side of the hand where you would hit if you did a karate chop, this is the small intestine meridian point, tap here straight after tapping the index finger. keep doing this repeatedly as often as you can throughout the detox, it help tremedously.\nBest of luck.\n\nCraig - Naturopath.

__label__2 , How do plants germinate?,,Plants do not germinate. Seeds do. Germination happens when a baby plant is growing. The plant is between the cotyledons. This is a seed. The seed is underground and is collecting nutrients.\n\nWhen a seed begins to grow, we say it germinates. The cotyledons store food for the baby plant inside the seed. When the seed starts to germinate, the first thing to come out is the main root. The skin starts to split and the tiny shoot straightens, carrying the cotyledon(s) with it. The main root gets bigger. Side roots appear and so do leaves. To grow, the seed's growing conditions usually have to be damp, warm, and dark, like springtime soil. A dry seed will stay dormant unless it soaks in some water. Then it will start to germinate.

First, thoroughly develop your idea and document it professionally, clearly, and in great detail.\n\nThen, apply for a patent through the US patent office.

If your idea has merit, they will buy the patent from you and develop it themselves.
__label__4 , when someone is getting a masters or doctorate, what do they have to do for a thesis?,also what is the difference in education between a masters and doctorate degree?,Most master's programs are 1 or 2 years, depending on the specialty.

A master's thesis usually isn't too in depth, so a basic research project - you'll need to understand all the background material and have done something original.  For a Ph.D., you'll need original, publishable research and a mastery of the background and current research in the field.
__label__10 , what is pakistan's contribution against terrorism???,,Pakistan is probably the only country in the world right now with so much at stake in the War Against Terrorism. Please let’s not forget that it is our soldiers who are battling the terrorists in the front lines of Waziristan and Afghan border and dying in the process. The numbers of arrests made by Pakistan has been incredible, well over a thousand so far since 2002. The citizens of this country have had to sacrifice more innocent lives to terrorists over the last five years than were lost in the 9/11 bombing. Despite all these problems, Pakistani people have shown resilience and fortitude and have made a sincere and passionate effort to improve their lives. No matter what the negatives of our country are, as there are with every nation, these facts should not be overlooked and should be appreciated.\n\nOur biggest problem is that the less than 1% of the Pakistanis involved in terrorist activities are giving a totally negative image to the 99.5% remaining population which wants to live in peace and be a part of the global community. \n\nIf you want to analyze Pakistan properly, just think back to all the news stories that have ever been printed or aired on Pakistan and try to cite only one story which mentions this country in a positive light. I can promise you that you will not find any such news article. Now, a logical mind can easily comprehend that a country can't be all bad! Yet, none of the positive aspects ever get portrayed. No one will cite the strong arrest record of this Country. No one will mention the number of Pakistani dead while effectively fighting terrorists in the no-man's land area between Pakistan and Afghanistan. No one will remember that it was Pakistan who fought and won the war against Soviet occupation in Afghanistan. True, the USA supplied weapons and finance but it was Pakistani strategy that won that war as has been recognized by the US Government. \n\nI hope you will look at Pakistan with an open mind and see that Pakistanis are people trying to improve their lot in life as well. We have problems common to third world countries and unfortunately our democratic institutions are not as strong as the majority of us would like them to be. Yet, we are a great country and, God willing, will one day prove our worth to the entire world.

__label__3 , Location of Fat storage?,when your body stores fat, is there any particular area it stores it first (ie: love handles, and then arms, thighs, etc?). i'm a guy that works out a lot  but i have a slight pug in my belly, so i need to work that out more...but i wonder where the body stores the fat first before it goes to the belly (if there is such a hirearchy system).,Well your body stores fat in certain areas before others due primarily to genetics.  That's partially why you can see similarities among family members' body types, regardless of whether they are overweight or not. Men do tend to store fat in the belly region first, and something interesting is that women usually lose fat in their breasts before anywhere else. I'm sure you look fine - have fun working out!

I m confused, the first guy likes me but he is not ready for marriage , should I wait?, and I m not sure of his feelings towards me, I m afraid if he is lying on me, and he wants to pass  time with me (just words). and  I do not know who is the good one for me , the one who i can liv e  happy with him. simply, should I wait the first one if he is really wants me or marry the secnd one' I do not like him and I do not want to know him' ?.,I believe you have answered the question yourself. When you say that you don't like the second guy and you don't want to know him then he is basically not a choice anymore.\nHowever, since the first guy is not ready for marriage, a good way to test him would be to tell him that you have been proposed by someone else and since he is not ready for marriage so you are confused about this relationship and ask him for a definite answer.\nIn the meanwhile, I would suggest to at least meet the other guy once. As far as I know seeing is believing. You never know what good may be waiting for you there. No need to give him your contact number or anything else in the first meeting just keep it to the introduction and to general topics. If he tries to advance too fast then obviously he just trying to get into your pants.\nThink I have written enough. Will be good to know your decision and progress.\nTake care

__label__2 , are the c5a and 747 jets the same size?,,In most respects, they're pretty close.  (Details of the 747 vary by model.)\n\nThe wingspan of the 747-400ER, a current model, is over 211 feet.  The wingspan of the Galaxy (C-5a) is about 223 feet.\n\nThe 747-400ER is about 232 feet long.  The Galaxy is about 247 feet long.\n\nThe heights are about the same, at almost 64 feet for the 747-400ER and about 65 feet for the Galaxy.\n\nThe maximum takeoff weight for the 747-400ER is 910,000 pounds; for the Galaxy, it's 840,000.\n\nBoeing has announced a bigger version of the 747, the 747-8.  It will have a wingspan of almost 225 feet, a length of as much as 250 feet, and a height between 63 and 64 feet.  The maximum takeoff weight will be 960,000 pounds.\n\nBut, even though the new 747 will be definitely bigger, it still won't have the cool front-and-rear cargo ramps and a cargo bay big enough to drive a tank through, like the Galaxy does.

__label__10 , Why is it ok for USA to have nuclear weapons but nobody else?,Don't get me wrong I support this country but why can't we allow anyone else to have nuclear weapons? Are we that paranoid?,It's called Fascism..... it was huge in Europe in the 1940's.\n\nPersonally, I think it's best that Iran doesn't aquire nukes.....\n\nSome leaders will use them without thinking of the consequences.\n\nPS.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of people on here who are under the illusion that most of the anti-US feeling from other countries is unwaranted. Some of the hatred towards the US stems from US foreign policy and activites of the CIA but most of it begins with resentment towards the corporations like Coca-cola, McDonalds and the large financial and mineral corporations. Some countries are seriously affraid for their culture and their freedom.  They  have a very real concern about the infection of Americanisation in their society.\n\nThat is the reason why so many countries want to arm themselves with nukes. In the middle East there is growing resentment and hatred towards the US. Threats like  The use of Military force has not been ruled out do not help to calm countries like Iran and Syria and  do not lead them to beleive the US to be friendly. \n\nIf you combine these factors with zealous, hateful teachings that bear no relationship to the teachings of the Qur'an being aggressively promoted by maniacs on a power trip. These feed off the fears of decent people and the change in them begins. \n\nIt's very easy for a lot of people to blame the US directly for their problems. A large ammount of problems in the third world ARE the fault of US corporations and Government. It comes down to the individual to not accept or indulge in the things on offer from the US.\n\nMy point is that the US is becoming an Empire and in doing so they are provoking very dangerous people. Empires grow and consume other other organisations and societies. They deplete their resources, violate their people and their culture and turn the people in to slaves. Would you want that done to your own country? How would it feel to have Taliban troops walking down your street kicking in the doors, needlessly violating, torturing and killing the occupants (you, you neighbours, your children)? Would that make you feel welcoming towards them or would you fight back? you would fight back becaause even the most peace loving among you would not be able to bear what you see.\n\nRealistically, people look for an answer in desperate times and that is most likely to involve religion - that is the same globally.\nAny religion in the world promotes peace. So when people adhere to a faith and something American starts to interfere with their faith...porn, Hollywood films, drugs, alcohol, western unmodest fashion etc. the psychological association is there that the US is evil, promoting all these obscene things to tempt people away from God and their faith. Anybody in that situation would be hostile. Add the fear of invasion and that's when terrorism begins. Those people believe they have a very realistic reason to seek WMD's. The problem is that they get carried away with the whole idea that they are good and the US is evil. They then forget to question whether their own actions are right or wrong. \n\nTheir countries are also run by politicians who are greedy liars just the same as all of our politicians are. They manipulate their people through the media as well. They promote the anti-US feeling to the people. Before you know it there is a very clear and present danger to the American way of life and that has to be preserved which may involve aggressive military action against a whole group of countries and organisations that are hostile to the US....which, to apply a catchy name to group the whole lot together with out actually directly blaming any of them: we could call them something like the Axis of Evil for example.\n\nSee at this point  a whole load of false ideas have destroyed peoples ability to think rationally on all sides. \n\nAt this point your Government seeks to eradicate any external threats and in fear of

__label__3 , What should i eat/ not eat to help cure my hemmroids?,what is a basic diet of things that i should not eat to prevent my hemmroids from flaring up?,Hello:\nThis is in response to the question you posted about curing hemorrhoids.\nActually, there is really no cure for them, except maybe for surgery where they basically take a rubber band and place it around the lesion until it dies and falls off but there are other forms of surgery as well.\nAS I said, there is really no cure but there a many things you can do to either prevent recurrence or the amount of time between exacerbations.\nProbably the most important is increasing the amount of fiber in your diet. If you are like most Americans, I diet is horrendous and we dont get nearly the amount of fiber we need. You can supplement with either Konsyl-D, Benefiber, Metamucil (I find personally that benefiber is the best because it doesnt have a bad taste and it doesnt turn into a gelatinous material that you have to force down.\nOther things that can exacerbate hemorrhoids are heavy lifting and sitting too long without getting up and walking around. Especially on airplanes or long car trips. The other thing that is a must is lots and lots of water at least eight glasses of water per day minimum.\nI dont know what kind of hemorrhoids you have. There are actually two forms: internal and external. The external are the ones you can actually see hanging out and are very painful, itchy and down right aggravating. Then the internal ones which are completely painless and tend to bleed more. Most of the time people dont even know they have internal hemorrhoids until they go to their doctors complaining of blood in their stool, then a colonscopy is done and thats when they find them.\nTry as best as you can to keep from getting constipated. The pushing and straining you do can worsen hemorrhoids. That is where the plenty of water and fiber come into play.\nAny food that is high in fiber will help. Bran, oats, wheat germ, celery, corn (yes even popcorn without the butter and salt of course).\nI hope this helped you with your question. it was my pleasure to answer it for you.\nWarren Shaffer, M.D.

__label__6 , What would Ken Griffey Jr estimated home run total be right now had he not ever been injured?,,All right, I'm not going to look at what he has done so far this season.... because it's just easier to figure out that way.  \n\nHe's played in 2125 games, which would amount to about 14 seasons if he were to play 155 games each year.  He's actually in his 18th season, so you got to figure he's basically missed three years of playing time (remember, I'm not counting this season, so he's played 17 complete seasons).  \n\nHis home run total coming into the season was 536, which over 14 seasons of playing time averages out to 38 home runs per year.  If you take that average over the three seasons that he missed, it would come out to 114.  So, theoretically, he should have been at about 650 coming into this season, which with his 12 so far this year would put him at 662, and on pace for about 688 by the end of this season.  \n\nHowever, he was at 398 before coming to Cincinnati.  In his last four years in Seattle, he was averaging 52 per season.  He's in Cincy for his 7th season this year.  If he doesn't get injured and even averages 45 HR/season, he'd be looking at 713 at the end of this season.\n\nAs if this isn't way too much already, another way of looking at it - \nHe has averaged 3.7 AB/G, and a 14.68 HRR (home run ratio - the number of AB's between each HR).  If he played 155 games per season, he would have 2635 games, and 9750 AB's, which would translate into 664 HR's at the beginning of this season, and 703 at the end of this season.
__label__3 , My head hurts, Did I take too much?,,I looked at your profile where you said lost and alone. I also looked at your questions. One was on marriage and divorce and getting your heart broken and another was about why life is so disappointing. Another question was if anyone has ever thought about murder. You seem to be suffering from depression or some other mental illness. My guess is that you took an overdose of pills to kill yourself and now you have second thoughts. If this is the case, get someone to take you to the emergency room at the closest hospital or call 911. In any case, you need to see a psychiatrist asap or at least talk with your doctor who can advise you or refer you to someone in the mental health department. Depression is nothing to be ashamed of and you should seek help. Let us hear from you. God bless.

__label__2 , What adaptations does a xerophyte have that makes it able to store water? I need this for school?,,Desert Plant Adaptations\nDesert plants have adapted to the extremes of heat and aridity by using both physical and behavioral mechanisms, much like desert animals.\n\nPlants that have adapted by altering their physical structure are called xerophytes. Xerophytes, such as cacti, usually have special means of storing and conserving water. They often have few or no leaves, which reduces transpiration.\n\nPhreatophytes are plants that have adapted to arid environments by growing extremely long roots, allowing them to acquire moisture at or near the water table.\n\nOther desert plants, using behavioral adaptations, have developed a lifestyle in conformance with the seasons of greatest moisture and/or coolest temperatures. These type of plants are usually (and inaccurately) referred to as perennials, plants that live for several years, and annuals, plants that live for only a season.\n\nDesert perennials often survive by remaining dormant during dry periods of the year, then springing to life when water becomes available.\n\nMost annual desert plants germinate only after heavy seasonal rain, then complete their reproductive cycle very quickly. They bloom prodigiously for a few weeks in the spring, accounting for most of the annual wildflower explosions of the deserts. Their heat- and drought-resistant seeds remain dormant in the soil until the next year's annual rains.\n\nXerophytes\nThe physical and behavioral adaptations of desert plants are as numerous and innovative as those of desert animals. Xerophytes, plants that have altered their physical structure to survive extreme heat and lack of water, are the largest group of such plants living in the deserts of the American Southwest.\n\nEach of the four southwestern deserts offers habitats in which most xerophytic plants survive. But each is characterized by specific plants that seem to thrive there. The Great Basin Desert is noted for vast rolling stands of Sagebrush and Saltbush, while in the Mojave Desert, Joshua Trees, Creosote Bush, and Burroweed predominate. The Sonoran Desert is home to an incredible variety of succulents, including the giant Saguaro Cactus, as well as shrubs and trees like mesquite, Paloverde, and Ironwood. The Chihuahuan Desert is noted for mesquite ground cover and shrubby undergrowth, such as Yucca and Prickly Pear Cactus.\n\nCactus, xerophytic adaptations of the rose family, are among the most drought-resistant plants on the planet due to their absence of leaves, shallow root systems, ability to store water in their stems, spines for shade and waxy skin to seal in moisture. Cacti originated in the West Indies and migrated to many parts of the New World, populating the deserts of the Southwest with hundreds of varieties, such as the Beavertail Cactus and Jumping Cholla.\n\nCacti depend on chlorophyll in the outer tissue of their skin and stems to conduct photosynthesis for the manufacture of food. Spines protect the plant from animals, shade it from the sun and also collect moisture. Extensive shallow root systems are usually radial, allowing for the quick acquisition of large quantities of water when it rains. Because they store water in the core of both stems and roots, cacti are well-suited to dry climates and can survive years of drought on the water collected from a single rainfall.\n\nMany other desert trees and shrubs have also adapted by eliminating leaves -- replacing them with thorns, not spines -- or by greatly reducing leaf size to eliminate transpiration (loss of water to the air). Such plants also usually have smooth, green bark on stems and trunks serving to both produce food and seal in moisture.\n\nPhreatophytes\nPhreatophytes, like the mesquite tree, have adapted to desert conditions by developing extremely long root systems to draw water from deep underground near the water table. The mesquite's roots are considered the longest of any desert plant and have been recorded as long as 80 feet. Botanists do not agree on the exact c

Just because you've not had some big talk too doesn't mean he's seeing someone else. Who says he's dating around?  Bet you have nothing to worry about! Don't dare try to have that talk either.  Just let him do the chasing and have fun with you're together.  If you start hinting/asking him about being exclusive you're gonna not only get on his nerves but drive him away as well.  Just let nature take its course....Live and enjoy!

__label__2 , A car can pump 500 gallons of gas in 20 minutes. How much gas can a car pump in 30 minutes?,,These are just similar ratios:\n\n500 gallons / 20 minutes = x gallons / 30 minutes\n\n500 / 20 = x / 30\n\nNow solve for x (you can cross multiply if you like):\n20x = 15000\nx = 750 gallons.\n\nIt's also rather intuitive to see that you got 500 gallons in 20 minutes.  So in 10 minutes more, you will pump half again as much.  500 + 250 = 750 gallons.

__label__5 , How do I copy MS Office to my new PC from my old one?,How do I copy MS Office to my new PC from my old one?,The only way you can copy it is to have your hard drive cloned in the new computer (i.e. a direct 1to1 image of your old drive will be copyied using a software like Ghost or Drive image to your new drive). Just a copy/paste process won't do.\n\nOr you can search for the install CD and reinstall, so all the files go into their (right) places and the necessary info is written in the Windows' registry.\n\nI would say the first method is best, because it takes just a few minutes and it brings you all the other applications you installed, not to mention also the O.S. and all your personal data and settings! (usualy you can loose any time from few hours to couple of days to make it from scratch).

__label__1 , why can't each country print it's own money? don't say inflation and bla bla bla!?,,Don't they?\nIf you're talking about countries that use the Euro, it's beacause in such a tightly packed continent with consumers readily traversing country borders, the plan was to adopt a universal currency and do away with conversion rates.\nIf you're talking about countries that use American dollars, well that's because America is the largest economic power in the world and US currency is taken most everywhere.

However, it needs to be asked because...well damn it, just because I'm asking so that's reason enough. Anyway, I'll be thinking about is there really a heaven, and also I'll be thinking about is there anyway I can do something that takes an all out effort before I'm going to die. Example: Tell someone something that I can pass on to someone else to where they make sure they don't forget to keep passing what I say on to someone so in a way I'm never forgotten. Kind of like the Bible. Legendary words made true. Passed on for thousands of years.

Look forward to going to the Otherworld to feast with my deities.  Rest peacefully.

We are considering the Dell Latitude 620.  Does anyone own this model?  If so, are you enjoying it?  Also, how are you accessing the Internet?  I am considering either a Cingular or Sprint Wireless Access Plan.  Any details on that as well?\nThanks!!,the xps 600 is not a laptop. HUGE DESKTOP!  I've ordered 14 laptops for my company in the last 2 months.  I would suggest either the inspiron 9400 (low end) or if necessary the latitude 810 or 620 .  The XPS laptos are VERY expensive starts at 2500.  very good though (graphically). An inspiron is probaly the best though for the money.  Latitude would probably be second on my list though.

__label__2 , When was the last time you hit your funny bone?,What is a funny bone? Why do they call it that?,about a week ago. Your funny bone is actually not a bone it is the ulnar nerve in your elbow. This is the only place on your body that is not covered by cartilage or bone. Thats why it hurts so bad when you hit it... right on the spot! its called the funny bone because the nerve runs through your humerus bone which is located by your bicep.
__label__2 , what is perceptual control theory?,,Perceptual control theory (PCT) is a psychological theory of animal and human behavior originated by William T. Powers.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_Control_Theory#History\n\nIn contrast with other theories of psychology and behavior, which assume that behavior is a function of perception — that perceptual inputs determine or cause behavior — PCT finds that an organism's behavior is a means of controlling its perceptions.\n\nPCT differs from engineering control theory in that the reference variable for each negative feedback control loop in a control hierarchy is set from within the system (the organism), rather than by a separate controller.\n\nThe Control Systems Group is a non-profit professional organization of individuals involved in research in and applications of perceptual control theory.

__label__5 , Why is it that an E-mail would take a day to come back  Mailer Daemon ?,Seems that usually if there is an error in the address one types, a  Mailer Daemon message comes back almost immediately. What possibly could cause it to take a  day  plus / minus to return ? Appreciate a knowlegeable answer.,The Mailer Deamon is the name of the program on your email providers server that is trying to send out the mail. What it's doing is trying over and over again to send out the mail. It doesn't stop when it fails the first time because it doesn't know if the server that would accept the mail is just temporarily unavailable, rather than non-existent.

Answer as you wish, Thx.,I'm not right wing but... the economy and education was great... was that his doing probably some yes and some congress, which for most of his presidency was Republican controlled... \n\nCutting spending, which also had something to do with the congress, was also very impressive... who exactly is the conservative president and who is the liberal president... if you just looked at the numbers and not a party affiliation, Clinton looks conservative and Bush looks very liberal in spending... both were under Republican congresses... just saying...\n\nHe approved of sending troops into somolia and kosovo... two regions that were bad off and needed help...I think if he was still in (and had been in the whole time), we wouldn't be in Iraq, we would be in Afghanistan and we would be in Darfur... which, just me, I think would be a better place than we are in now, and we would be saving more lives...\n\nMost people I know were better off under Clinton...

__label__10 , Why can't the Democrats get it? Why aren't they redesigning their message so more people get on the bandwagon.,It seems there is an enormous opportunity now for the Democrats to really build up steam and followers, but they grind on the same old saw and seem scared to death to set themselves apart from the fear mongering Republicans.,It seems to me that the Dem's only message of late is We hate republicans, and we disagree with the Bush administration.  That's it. They cannot agree on what they want to do to make the country better, or how they plan to fix what they consider to be problems created by the Bush administration.  Until they unify and come up with a clear plan, I doubt they'll be able to significantly increase their appeal.

__label__3 , How can I be more optimistic?,I keep thinking so negatively.,I think the basis of Positive thinking is that whatever your major focus is on, is the best way to make it happen. Not everything will turn out exactly as you want it too..but when your mind is focused on positive things and positive thoughts, you start producing more positive results. The best illustration I can think of is like when you bowl or golf, I was taught that when you let go of the ball in bowling, to leave your arm pointed in the direction you want the ball to go and not to put your arm down immediately. It works. But it's because some people bring their arm down just a fraction of an instant before they let go of the ball and that changes the direction of the ball. So if you leave your arm pointed where you want it to go and it's a habit to do that, then more than likely your ball will head where you want it too. And your mind works the same way. A positive minded person always believes there is a way to accomplish something and most of them do. A negative thinker almost always thinks something can't be done and because of that, they give up and it doesn't happen. You fail before you start because your mind is overwhelmed with the thought that it can't happen in the first place. When you keep your mind focused and believe that something can be done...you usually do find a way to do it. Just make sure you really want what you ask for.
__label__4 , Why does everyone keep telling me to go to college? I know I should go but I can't afford it. Why?,Everyone keeps telling me to go to college. I can't afford it. My cousin told me not to get loans. He said it's because when you graduate you'll have all this debt. He said it took him 2 years after graduation to find a decent job. Now he only makes enough to pay for everything he needs and still has this huge debt. What should I do?,You should do like me and talk to your local Marine Corps Recruiter. Trust me you won't have to worry about paying for college if you're dead, and if you're not they'll pay for you!\n\n\nI am being serious, I am in no way using sarcasm, sardon, or satire.

__label__6 , when is the first time broncos stared to play?,they are a football team,Since this is in the Rugby League category, I assume you want to know about the Brisbane Broncos. As mentioned, they first joined the NSWRL (now the NRL) in 1988. Their captain was Wally Lewis. Their first game was against the defending premiers Manly, whom they beat quite convincingly. From memory, it was about 44-10. And I think they won their first 6 games of the season too. \nThey went on to finish the year in 7th out of 16 teams, just missing the finals by one win (they had a five-team finals system in those days). Incidently, Manly (they beat them twice throughout the year) finished 4th and made the finals.\nThey managed to win their first premiership in 1992, going back-to-back in 1993.

__label__1 , is religion fact or something else we have no idea of? Thanks?,,I find your options too limited.  Its never been about facts, its about hope love and charity.  We all have a good idea what those virtues are, but there is not a fact among them.\nDoes a parent love their child?  You can't do experiments on that to decide, black or white, its true or false.  As the Savage Garden song goes, I believe parents did the best they knew how to do.\nDo you know if an elevator is safe, for a fact, before you go into it.  No, if you had to prove everything before you believed it - assumed it - you would be frozen with uncertainty.\nThe best you can hope for is reasonable certainty.\nReligion is reasonable, though many religious people are totally unreasonable in they way they talk about religion.\n\nI guess you think science is all about facts, but most of it is theory, reasonable assumptions.  Data have to be reasonably accurate but even with the best intentions, the next experiment could show a weakness in a theory.  That why they do the experiment.\n\nSo lets open our minds with a good degree of humility and be reasonable in the way we treat each other, we are all in this together.

My question is I would like to have a powerpoint presentation of me and my fiancee growing up and our families.  How do I go about this?  And where is a good place to go for good background music, like jazz and big band?  I am opting for CD's cause we want an inexpenseive and unique idea for this.--We are doing these instead of the dancing.,For good music, do a search on Amazon.com under music. You can search just big band or for a particular artist, like Dizzy Gillespie or Charlie Parker. Try to stick to instrumentals, since some people cannot listen to music with lyrics and carry on a conversation at the same time.

__label__10 , Do US Citizens think that Canada's immigration policy is too lax?,And that another Chinese wall should be build along the border between Canada and the US?,Canada and the US cooperate on protecting our mutual border in a way Mexico does not, so we feel more confident on that side of the nation.  However, even Canada has said recently that its amnesty grants have jumped proper checking for terrorist ties, and I understand they will be addressing that, going forward.\n\nI think we need to protect all of our borders.  However, I think we at least have a neighbor working in concert with us on this point on our northern side.
__label__9 , My fiancee said our relationship is going down the tubes...Is it true HELP?,We have been through so much together and we have been arguing alot lately.  I believe I am suffering in depression and I have back sliden significantly in my walk as a Christian.  We went to Vegas for a weekend trip with all of our friends and one night I got really drunk and yelled at him and berated him and told him I felt like beating him up or leaving the Room.  Needless to say I had a reason to be upset but not to express myself in that manner.  I felt ashamed and foolish.  I also got really insecure and starting begging him not to be mad at me and not to leave me.  He then said, since we have been engaged I feel our relationship as gone down the tubes...all we do is fight.  I immediately sensed that he didn't want to be with me anymore.  Since then he has not talked to me and has not come to bed for two days.  He hasn't asked for the ring back he hasn't asked me to leave, but he is totally ignoring me.. He keeps saying to leave him alone.  I am trying but it is really hard,You need professional help if you are going to save your relationship - and more importantly, save yourself.  You are definitely no longer in control of your depression or your drinking. \n\nGo to your pastor/priest and ask him to recommend a therapist and/or support group.  Go to your doctor and tell him/her about your depression.  Take action based upon their recommendations.  Then go to your fiancee and tell him about the steps you are taking, and ask him to attend couples/premarital counseling with you.\n\nDon't wait, don't make excuses, don't put this off.  Get help nnow and get yourself back on the right track.  Good luck!

True genius of the game and was unstoppable, he single handedly won the world cup in 1986 and on the world stage like that, that is a very very hard feit to accomplish.

There is an annual exclusion of $11,000 for gifts made to each person.  There is also a lifetime exclusion of $1.5 Million.  So the gift would not be taxable, but you would be using up part of that lifetime exclusion and any future gifts or your estate may be taxable (estate and gift taxes use the same exclusion).

Don't worry about being too fat for cheerleading, if you're good at it, they'll choose you. I'm sure your weight won't have to do with their decision.

__label__3 , I have HSV II and was wondering if a girl gave me a handjob can she contract the STD?,,Genital herpes (HSV-2) is passed from direct skin to skin contact. Even if you had no sores at the time she gave you a hand job, you could possibly be shedding the virus. So, I guess if she gave you a hand job and then rubbed her hand on her genital area, theoretically she could get the virus, although that is highly unlikely. \n\nThe best thing she can do is to wash her hands extremely good after she did that to you. Herpes simplex virus 2 has also been known to cause cold sores, which is usually herpes simplex virus 1, even though it is pretty rare. As long as he washed her hands good, and didn't touch her genital area or her mouth after wards, she should be okay.
__label__9 , If you were having a wedding but didn't get along with all your family...?,Would you still invite them to the wedding?  Say if every time you go to a family gathering for the holidays and they treated you differently than everyone else and treated you like crap and they always ruined the occassion for you because of their constant insulting remarks that you had to leave because they hurt your feelings so bad, would you still invite them to your wedding?  This is the most important day to you and you want the day to be special and you want nothing to ruin it but you know that if you invited everyone then that is exactly what will happen.  If you don't invite them, they might get hurt and then it will be on your mind all day.  What should you do in a situation like this?,The POLITE thing to do is to INVITE Them to the wedding.  They are family no matter what -- and family needs to be a part of the joyous occasion.
__label__5 , Why can't I access my yahoo e-mail account?,,There are many reasons why you cannot access your e-mail account, although I have noticed that Yahoo will randomly take accounts off line for anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks, especially if they see that there isn't very much activity on those accounts.\n\nPerhaps they do this if they're uploading new ads, or if one of their servers is having some problems. They have been known to disable certain accounts for awhile, although they usually put those accounts back on line within 3 weeks or thereabouts. Of course, they're certainly not going to admit to doing this, as you could imagine the number of complaints they would receive!\n\nOutside of that scenario, double check your username and password for spelling errors, as typos are the most common reason why people cannot access their e-mail accounts.

__label__3 , how do u know if there's a blood clot?,my head slammed on the frame of a door (not the flat bit, the corner bit), and it left a huge lump on the left side of my forehead. (i was walking in the dark, tripped and free falled on my face)\n\n3 days later, i notice a maroon spot, about the size of a red bean that's forming on the side of my left eye.\n\nits located about 4cm away from the major lump area. anyone knows why's this? and what can i do about it?,It's probably a bruise. A bruise is basically a clot of dead blood underneath your skin. It'll go away on it's own, but it never hurts to check with a doctor just in case....\n\nBy the way, if it is a blood clot, it's a superficial one, not the kind that can give you a heart attack or stroke. Those are caused by blood clots that are inside the veins (called deep vein thrombosis). What you did was open up a blood vessel (popped it) so the clot formed outside of the circulatory system. It'll be absorbed back into your body, but it won't float around and screw things up.
__label__9 , My boyfriend wants to see me and another woman have sex. and he wants me to find the woman. what do you think?,,Most guys, including me, enjoy seeing two chicks having sex.  We're turned on simply by looking at a naked women - so seeing two women have sex is just simply a bonus.  You should make sure it's something you want to do too.  And if you do then you have to think about jealeousy issues and him joining in.  Of course he's gonna want to join in.  No guy just wants to watch and then go home.  So think about that.  Then if he does join in are you going to get upset if you think he's more into her than you.  There are lots of things going on here that could toss your relationship around a bit.
__label__2 , please help with physics!!?,The displacement vector for a 15.0 second interval of a jet airplane's flight is (2450, −2430) m. (a) What is the magnitude of the average velocity? (b) At what angle, measured from the positive x axis, did the airplane fly during this time interval?,This is easy.  The displacement is sqrt(2450^2 + 2430^2) = 10 sqrt(245^2 + 243^2) = 3451 m, so the average velocity is 230 m/s.  (You had to divide by 15.)\n\nFor the angle, tan x = -243/245 = -0.99184\n\nThe angle is -44 degrees, 46 minutes

__label__9 , Should I tell my 9 and 8 year old children that their Mom's 'friend' is really their biological grandmother?,Six years ago I successfully located my biological mother who had given me up for adoption at birth.  We've established a relationship and see each other a few times a year as we live in different cities.  Both my adoptive parents are alive and i have a great relationship with them.  My biological mother is terminally ill and I fear she doesn't have much time left.  She never married or had other children.  Should I tell my children she's my biological mother before she passes away?  My adoptive father is also terminally ill and my children know he's sick but don't realize he won't be with us much longer.  I don't beleive there's a right or wrong answer here but I'd appreciate any advice I receive.  Either way, one day I have every intention of telling my kids that this 'family friend' was their biological grandfather.,I dont see what it would hurt to be honest. It would probably make your biological mother happy to have her recognized for who she really is. Plus what if later when you tell your kids about your mother they wish they had known so they could get to know her better but its too late? will they be mad at you for not telling them sooner? its a possibily. Dont over think this just be honest it will be easier in the long run.

__label__6 , How do I cast a line?,I recently tried fishing while on holiday with a new telescopic rod I bought. I found trying to cast out impossible, even with a weight on the end of the line. The line would get caught, or just tangle up. It looked so easy when others do it. Is there a knack?or do I have a crap reel. In the end I had to just lower the line down into the water over where I was sitting.,Ryan G makes a very good point when using a telescoping fishing rod. It's very easy to get your line wrapped around the rod unintentionally.\nOther than that you should check to see that your line is wound properly onto the spool and not tangled onto interior working parts. This happens often on spin-cast reels that are spooled with too much line.\nWhen reeling in your line keep a slight pressure on it by holding it between your fingers. It helps the line to spool evenly and helps detect light bites.\n\nBest of luck.

__label__1 , Why do people make there decisions about gays determined on morals?,I keep wondering why people only base there feelings on religous and moral beliefs and not on what that person feels because last time that i checked we are all humans so we deserve to be able do the things that a heterosexual couples and i think that people should worry more about our rights as humans also,Organized Religion is an ingenious way to control  masses of people, collect money from them, make them feel guilt,\nand tell them how to think. Because some people are easily led they do what they are told, no questions asked.They are afraid or don't know how to think for themselves,so they let someone else tell them what and how to think about any particular thing.It's easy to hide behind Religion, easy to hide on a key board and easy let let someone do your thinking for you,because then you cannot be 100% responsible for what you say or believe. So  they take the easy way.The last time I checked THE BIBLE, I read \nLove Thy Neighbour.\n maybe that is the one sentence they did not read.For some of us who think for ourselves, (yes some of us believe in God ) we do not judge, hate, or say what we are told to. We do worry that gay rights should be in line with the rights other people have and we may not understand all about gay culture but little by little we educate  ourselves by making friends with gay people, reading about gays and asking our gay friends things we don't understand about the gay culture. And because we do these things, our lives are enriched beyond compare to people who don't.

It raises the question of whether government action which does not actually appropriate land creates such barriers to its use that it amounts to a taking within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment (nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation).\n\nGenerally speaking the courts have answered no to such claims and, on the facts you present, my opinion is that you have little chance of succeeding in any lawsuit. \n\nThere is simply no right to demand that city planning authorities act in such a way as to ensure that your land will be attractive to developers.

Are you sure on the album title?\n\n~~~~\n\nOkay thanks for the clarification - then that would be Kraftwerk's Neon Lights - a better cover than OMD did on Sugar Tax, but still not as good as the original.\n\nAnd I'd argue that Kraftwerk are STILL a success with the sales of their latest album (and dbl-cd live album) and their sold out world tour as good examples.\nProps to U2 for covering a true classic...

Ask about Tricor, Zetia, and/or Niaspan or Niacin to help lower your Triglycerides.  To lower your LDL and total cholesterols, stay away from cheese, red meat, and any type of animal fatty foods. To lower your triglycerides, limit your sweets, alcohol, carbohydrates (which quickly turn into sugar in the body), this includes natural sugars (as in fruits) also...it is still sugar. No more than about 3 servings of fruits a day, including juices. If you like carbohydrates, choose high fiber carbs.

Homeruns are all he hit but he, along with Sosa revitalized the national pasttime unlike any players in the last 30 years.

__label__7 , avoid capital gains taxes?,how do i reduce my capital gains tax bill. i have started buying and selling shares with beals of up to £10000 a time . will i get hit with a big tax bill at the end of the year,when you say 10000 a time, do you mean actual gains?  what i mean is to calculate your gain, you subtract your basis(what you purchased it for) from your sales price (what you sold it for).  If that is amounting to 10000 a time, then yes - you have to pay capital gains on that.  \n\nhow do you reduce?  well, if you have other investments that are not doing so well, and you think they wont ever do well, sell them at a loss.  this will reduce your capital gains.  this includes any capital assets you have - real estate, investments, etc, etc.  other than that, there really is no way you can avoid taxes because you already sold them for a gain.  in the future, what i would recommend is at least holding the investments for over a year to ensure long term capital gains rates.

__label__1 , Why are MANY Americans so culturally insensitive?,I was recently on a business trip to Texas and I noticed that when people were speaking to me they often spoke loudly and slowly. My usual respose was (in a slow condicending way)\nI understand you, there is no need to yell at me, If I couldn't speak the language I wouldn't be asking you. \nIt just annoys me as I really don't see that much in Vancouver, my hometown. For that matter I haven't experienced anything like that in my travels to other places.\nDo most people of Indian origin in America need people to yell and speak slowly to them?,Think of it like this. I wouldn't call it so much culturally insensitive as it is stupid, because if they were culturally insensitive, they would make fun of you because your race. Saying things slow, they are more DUMB because they see the race that you are and they automatically think they need to speak slow. That has nothing to do with cultural insensitivity, that has to do with the amount of intelligence a person has. I used to live in Texas. Trust me, some people, depending on where your living, are quite slow and dumb, so I wouldn't think much about that particular thing.

__label__10 , how long do fire extinguishers last?,,If kept in a clean and dry place and the original seal is in tact, it should last a long time.\n\nThat being said, it's still a good idea to have it inspected anually by a extinguisher service company.  CO2 units DO NOT typically have a pressure guage and can leak.  Halongenated Agents, Pressurized Water, and Dry Chemical types do have a pressure guage or indicator button so at least you know the unit is up to pressure. \n\nIn the United States, CO2 and Pressurized water units must be hydrotested every 5 years.  Dry Chemical and Halogenated Agent units must be instpected internally every 6 years and recharged and come due for a hydrotest every 12 years.  If a unit fails this test, then it must be replaced.  Sometimes, depending on the size of the unit, it may just be less expensive to consider replacing the unit instead of paying for the test and possibly having it fail.  \n\nSomething of note: NFPA 10 (the national standard on portable fire extinguishers) is coming out with a new edition that will mandate the replacement of any stored-pressure dry chemical older than 1984.
__label__7 , Thrown Under the Bus?,I have been at this company for less than a year and become friends with Co-Worker A.  I have heard some horrible things about this person, that were not true and were twisted around by someone else that Co-Worker A considers a friend.  So, I got on the topic of gossip in the workplace and metnioned to Co-Worker A that she should be careful of the people she shares personal information with.  I didn't mention how I came across this information, nothing specific.  She immediately goes around and tells people that I told her to be careful, of nobody in particular and asking if they knew or heard anything.  I feel that I was wrong for trying to be a friend and warn her in general, because it isn't a good idea to discuss your personal business at work.  Am I wrong for being upset with her for basically throwing me under the bus?  Either way, I'll keep my mouth shut the next time!!!  Thanks.,sorry to say Cutegal, some people you can talk to and others you can't.\n\nfor some reason this person feels she need confirmation from others; than herself, there is a lack of something, she is not content with herself; if she is going to trade her personal information for friendship that is a red flag, not only that if she trade her own info, she will trade yours!!! so stay away.\n\nIf she can't take your advice and realize that she have more enemies than friends and that you are actually taking a chance for her, by doing a good deed at work by warning her than she has a problem. she is setting her self up for maddness. I learned you can't talk to certain people about certain things. You have to be aware of the person minds state and be able to perdict, how they would handle it or take it. this person did not find herself yet; she is not comfortable in her skin (not good) obvisiously she didn't learn he lesson, yet. she will get a wake up call , I just hope it doesn't cost anything.\n\nbut this was a lesson for you also, look at it in a positive way, you have just collected another piece of knowlage to add to the wisdom of life.

Do the old cardinals  retire or what happens to them ? Is it true ONLY the newly elected cardinals are responsible and allowed to vote for the next pope (#17) after #16 has died?,Benedict the XVI means he is the 16th Pope to take the name Benedict since the beginning of the church...it has nothing to do with the number of cardinals.\n\nThe College of Cardinals is like the Supreme Court, appointed by the Pope but serve for life.  Cardinals serve for life, but can only vote for a new Pope if they are younger than 80 years old.\n\nSo to answer your questions in order...\n\n1. Nothing\n2.  No...they serve for life\n3.  No...there are almost 200 of them.\n4.  No, all cardinals under the age of 80 will be responsible for voting in the next pope.  There are 193 Cardinals and 120 of them are under 80 right now.\n\nThe next Pope won't necessarily be the 17th. The last one was the second (John Paul II).  If that Pope chooses the name of Benedict, (yes, they choose their own names) then he would be the 17th.  Otherwise, he will either be John Paul III or John the 27th or Peter II, depending what he chooses.

You never know though. Some guys may really like you but be terrified of you at the same time. I never could understand why in high school boys were so mean to the girls they really liked. Hang in there. It gets better with time and you will meet someone you will be crazy about and they will feel just the same about you.
__label__10 , news on police shooting of US military man in California?,After a car chase police officer shot a US soldier while following instructions to stand up.,The cop said Shut up NOT get up! The guy ran from them and was acting like a dangerous criminal and was treated like one. Not until later was the guy identified as a member of the armed forces.\n\n**MattDCNavy** He made no threatening moves? How about standing up after fleeing from the police (A felony) that’s not threatening?? How many times you ever been in a high speed chase and pulled a guy 2X your size out of a car? As for the power trip... I actually have to agree with you. But I want to add this... Police have to be different from most people (Same with Service members) when people are shooting or beating people or threaten to blow things up MOST NORMAL people run away. Cops & soldiers have to have the mindset to be able to run towards the situation. This causes us to maybe be alittle arrogant at times.
__label__6 , Can you see any of the teams who finished in last place in MLB win the World Serie this decade?,The six teams that were in last place were Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Kansas City Royals, Seattle Mariners, Washington Nationals, Pittsburgh Pirates, and the Colorado Rockies?,The devil rays are stacked with young players in the majors and high minors and are finally moving in the right direction, but play in a division stacked with financial heavyweights. They need too much pitching help to make the Series having to beat out the sox and yanks, and even the Jays by the end of the decade. But at least there is some hope for the future. \n\nThe Pirates have developed a dynamite young pitching staff which makes them at least an interesting team to watch. The NL Central is not stocked with financial heavyweights and if the pirates can just get a couple of bats to go with Bay, and the young pitchers continue to develop they have at least a punchers chance. \n\nThe Nationals chances for a championship lie with whoever buys them in the future and their fiscal policies. The end of the decade seems to soon for them to win.\n\nThe Royals ...LOL..I could try and say something positive about them, but my Mamma taught me not to lie.\n\nThe Mariners also have a shot. The Angels have big money and talent in the division, but the M's could compete with everybody else. Beltre is a monster, Ichiro is excellent, and Hernandez may be one of the top 5 pitchers in the ML. They may have the best team of this group and the best chance of appearing in the World Series.\n\nThe rockies will never be able to attract the pitching it takes to make the world series. They seem to be taking a step back.

__label__9 , What would you do if you were me?,I have met this guy in school a month ago. He is so good-looking and i cannot help myself from getting attracted to him. We are classmates and we would usually go together in class, eat lunch and dinner together most of the time and would go out in weekends. If we are alone together he is so sweet to me, he usually holds my hand and kisses me. But there are so many girls that would flirt with him and he is aware of it, and same with most guys he likes it and would usually flirt with them too. And sometimes this would happen in front of me. I know that we are not officially on and I'm not in the position to complain because I'm not his official girlfriend but it really hurts me everytime this would happen. I really care about him and many times I have attempted to avoid him but this seems to be very difficult for me. I want to talk with him about how i feel but i'm afraid that he would not see me again.,

__label__5 , can someone send me a G-mail invite?,yahoo is not working,i finally noticed your email address. your invite is on the way. ignore my other email.\n\nHere is some information that will help you with GMail.\n\nNOTE: THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! GMAIL IS STILL BEING BETA TESTED SO THE PART YOU FIRST SEE WHEN YOU FIRST LOGIN ISNT WORKING CORRECTLY YET. NOT ALL OF THE FEATURES IN THAT SECTION HAVE BEEN ADDED YET. AT THE VERY TOP YOU WILL SEE A LINK THAT SAYS STANDARD VIEW CLICK ON IT TO GET TO THE WORKING PART OF GMAIL.\n\nOne of the best features is how easy it is to keep up with a conversation with a single friend. All of your previous posts to that\nperson are right there for you to review in case you forgot what you were talking about. Another good feature is that everyone that emails you is automatically added into your contacts list (address book). Currently there is no way to opt out of that. Maybe later they will add that feature.\n\nGMail is currently in beta testing and isn't ready to be released to the general public. This is why you had to be invited to use it instead of just signing up for it like you would normally do with everything else. Because it is still being tested it will occasionally not do what you want it to do. When this happens keep trying until it gives up and report it to one of the following GMail Help groups below.\n\nUsually after a week or two you will be given the ability to invite others to Gmail. You will know when the time comes because a form will appear in the lower-left corner of your screen. Also when answering an email you will see a link that says Invite So And So To Gmail. So and so is the name of the person you are emailing.\n\nhttp://groups-beta.google.com/group/Gmail-Help-Discussion\n\nhttp://groups-beta.google.com/group/Gmail-Generation\nhttp://s90215429.onlinehome.us/sjvilla79/content/gg-faq.html\n\nOther helpful GMail links.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail\nhttp://email.about.com/od/gmail/\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=gmail&hl=en&lr=&start=10&sa=N\n\nPLUS ADDRESSING\n\nGmail also supports plus-addressing of emails. Messages can be sent to addresses in the form: gmail.user+extratext@gmail.com where extratext can be any string. Plus-addressing allows users to sign up for different services with different aliases and then easily filter all e-mails from those services. It does not appear, however, that the +string feature works when sending email from a gmail account to itself. Additionally (in some cases) the string appended to the e-mail address may not be longer than six characters. Below is an example.\nfred@gmail.com and fred+amazon+shopping will send email to the same inbox.

Space adventures is a US company although Richard Branson (an englishman) owns a stake in it know.

If you have them transitioning every 10 seconds, that's 720 slides.\n\nEDIT: Prepare a 2 hr presentation on the surgical procedure with out making any slides. Than put together slides for your visual aids, and to cover main points in bullet points. The slides are just a tool to make what you are saying more easily understood. Make your outline for 2 hrs; add slides in where they help.

Their interest rates are normally below market allowing more favorable payments. However since this program is state sponsored, you would be required to provide a lot of documentation to determine your eligibility. Look on the state website and find information about it under the housing section. Hope this helps, contact me directly if you have any questions.

__label__2 , Aurora Borealis what is the cause of this phenomenon....?,( northern lights),The source of the auroras is the sun. The sun gives off high-energy charged particles (also called ions) that travel out into space at speeds of 200 to 440 miles per second. A cloud or gas of such ions and electrons is called a plasma. The stream of plasma coming from the sun is known as the solar wind. As the solar wind interacts with the fringes of the earth's magnetic field, the particles are shocked into flowing around the earth. Some of the particles are trapped by the earth's magnetic field. They follow the magnetic lines of force down to the ionosphere. The particles strike the gases in the ionosphere, causing them to glow, the same way electrons passing through the gases in a neon tube make a neon sign light up. The colors correspond to the different gases in the ionosphere. Oxygen atoms give off red and green light, depending on how high they are in the ionosphere. Nitrogen molecules give off blue and violet light.

__label__8 , does drinking more alcohol the next day help with hangovers?,,Nope. The only way to ease hangovers is drink a glass or two of water before you go bed after a night of drinking, and take two Tylenol. Alcohol pulls the water out of your system (basically dehydrates you), and it's the lack of water that gives you a hangover. If you put water back into your body before you go to bed you won't get a hangover. Since I found this out, I haven't had a hangover in four years.

If you have a lien on property you go to the top of the list as a secured creditor and can get almost full value. If you are a contractor and filed a mech lien or whatever they have in your state against the property that you did work on you should get paid. It also depends on the sitiuation if you are commercial or residental contractor. Lots of factors to take into account.
__label__7 , Will I be able to get a job?,I haven't been working for more than six years, will I be able to get a job easily or do I have to go to training to get a admin job,I was an interpreter before and also worked  in a office as an admin assistant. Im bored of sitting at home kids have started school,so Im free for few hours everyday. No silly answers please.,I am sure that there will be jobs which will only take people with specific training or qualifications, but from an employers point of view there are so many poor candidates applying for good jobs that those who have anything to offer really do stand out - qualifications or otherwise.\n\nI would suggest that you make your CV concise and engaging: use bullet points.  Most importantly let your personality shine through.  I always look at an applicant's personal details (i.e. hobbies and interests, personal statement etc.) before looking at qualifications because that's where I can find out most about the person. At the end of the day I need be sure I can get on with them.  Qualifications are invariably old and therefore less relevant.  \n\nI would also include previous experience and transferable skills - for instance if you have children you might well have excellent negotiation skills!\n\nBe confident, I'm sure that you'll find the conditions favourable out there.  Best of luck.

__label__4 , Help !!! Please !!! Couldn't see the diff.?,What is the diff between sharecropping and farm tanancy ?\n\nI SURELY APPRECIATE YOUR HELP !!!,they're pretty similar actually...farm tenancy is a person who lives on farm land owned by a landlord. The rights the tenant has over the land, and the form of payment, varies across different systems. In some systems, he could be evicted at whim (tenancy at will); in others, he signs a contract for a fixed number of years (tenancy for years or indenture).\n\nSharecropping is actually a form of tenant farming.  The people who are sharecroppers do not own any of the land they have...they basically grow items on the land and whatever profit they make off of it they give about 1/3 of it back to the owner.  This practice was mostly done after the civil war when plantation owners figured this would be a good practice to make a profit and keep their land tended to without losing their help.  \n\nBut anyway, I hope this little bit helps...

__label__4 , What civil rights do teachers of students with severe cognitive disabilities have when being hit ?,I have received no training in how to handle students who hit.  Only one of my teacher assistants has had restraint training.  We are constantly being hit (unexpectedly and unprovoked) by a young man with autism who laughs each time he strikes out at someone. I have recently suffered contusions to my jaw and a chipped tooth. My school's administration says they will not suspend the student because it would be thrown out at a manifestation hearing. I am convinced this student knows he is doing something wrong because of his facial expression.   My aides and I feel like we have no rights.  No one should have to go to work in education and expect to be hit daily because of a child's disability.  Morale is at a low point in my room.  I have been told by his parents that I am the first teacher to challenge him academically.  Last year's teacher let him roam the classroom while she taught the other students.  I am anxious and nervous in going to work everyday.  I love working with my other s,Unfortunately, the child's rights will always overrule yours since he is a special education student.  You are not covered by the same Zero Tolerance rules that regular ed. teachers are protected under.  \n\nI have had the same problem.  I have had a broken collarbone, bruised spleen, broken jaw, too many bites, contusions, bruises and gashes to count, and it always is the same line:  You are a special ed. teacher:  it comes with the territory.  It shouldn't be that way, but it's always come down to the same thing.\n\nNow -- there is one flaw that is apparent in your administrators' thinking:  they are allowed to suspend him up to 10 days per school year before it has to go to a manifestation hearing.  And a manifestation meeting only determines if his behavior is a direct result of his disability.  Most autistic kids don't automatically abuse their teachers!  I've had many that didn't!\n\nI have also had strong administrators that went to bat for the school and put this kind of kid (after worlds of documentation, mind you!) on homebound because HE WAS A DANGER TO HIMSELF AND OTHERS.  That has to be the key -- is he going to hurt another child?  It can't be YOU or another adult, but another student that is potentially at risk.\n\nIf that doesn't work, I have used parents to complain.  You have to be really careful in doing this, but a carefully worded verbal statement here and there can get the right parent in the office to advocate for the removal of that abusive student away from her child.  \n\nYour student probably does know what he is doing.  And I've been in your shoes for years -- wondering what part of my body is going to be injured next.  The front desk at the hospital know me by my first name when I walk in!  As trite as it sounds, just keep remembering that you are doing something that few people want to do, and that you are doing something wonderful.  \n\nGood luck, and get out your Special Ed. Manual to read about Manifestation.  There's a lot to know and most administrators don't know the true ins and outs about that.

__label__2 , how many blood types are in a humanbody?,,Humans have the following blood types along with their respective antigens and antibodies:\n\n    * Individuals with type A blood have red blood cells with antigen A on their surface and produce antibodies against antigen B in their blood serum. Therefore an A-negative person can only receive blood from another A-negative person or from an O-negative person.\n    * Individuals with type B blood have the opposite arrangement, antigen B on their cells and produce antibodies against antigen A in their serum. Therefore, a B-negative person can only receive blood from another B-negative person or from an O-negative person.\n    * Individuals with type AB blood have red blood cells with both antigens A and B and do not produce antibodies against either antigen in their serum. Therefore, a person with type AB-positive blood can safely receive any ABO type blood and is called a universal receiver. However an AB-positive person cannot donate blood except to another AB-positive person.\n    * Individuals with type O blood have red blood cells with neither antigen but produce antibodies against both types of antigens. Therefore, a person with type O-negative blood can safely donate to a person with any ABO blood type and is called a universal donor. However an O-negative person can only receive blood from another O-negative person.\n\nOverall, the O blood type is the most common blood type in the world, although in some areas, such as Sweden and Norway, the A group dominates. The A antigen is overall more common than the B antigen. Since the AB blood type requires the presence of both A and B antigens, the AB blood type is the rarest of the ABO blood types. There are known racial and geographic distributions of the ABO blood types. \n\nThe precise reason why people develop antibodies against an antigen they have never been exposed to is unknown. It is believed that some bacterial antigens are similar enough to the A and B glycoproteins, and that antibodies created against the bacteria will react to ABO-incompatible blood cells.\n\nApart from red blood cells, the ABO antigen is also expressed on the glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (vWF), which participates in hemostasis (control of bleeding). In fact, blood type O predisposes very slightly to bleeding, as vWF is degraded more rapidly. ABO antigens are also present in many other tissues such as liver, kidneys and lungs\n\nThe H antigen:\nThe A & B antigens are derived from a common precursor known as the H antigen. The H antigen is a glycosphingolipid (sphingolipid with carbohydrates bonded to the ceramide moiety) which is modified to produce the A and B antigens. In type O blood, it remains unchanged and consists of a chain of glucose, galactose, N-acetyl galactosamine, and fucose attached to the ceramide. Since it lacks N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) it is referred to as a globoside, not a ganglioside. Type A has an extra N-acetyl galactosamine bonded to the galactose near the end, while type B has a third galactose bonded to that near-end galactose.

Or is it just me?,not sure but maybe your talking about sleep paralysis: you kinda feel like you're awake but you can't move or that you might fall or you try to speak but you can't sorta like you're frozen awake---maybe that wiki thing has something -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis Sleep paralysis is a condition characterized by paralysis of the body shortly after waking up (known as hypnopompic paralysis) or, less often, shortly before falling asleep (known as hypnagogic paralysis). Physiologically, it is closely related to the normal paralysis that occurs during REM sleep, also known as REM atonia.\n\n \nThe Nightmare, by Henry Fuseli (1781) is thought to be one of the classic depictions of sleep paralysis perceived as a demonic visitation.Sleep paralysis occurs when the brain is awakened from an REM state into essentially a normal fully awake state, but the bodily paralysis is still occurring. This causes the person to be fully aware, but unable to move. In addition, this state is usually accompanied by certain specific kinds of hallucinations. This state usually lasts no more than two minutes before a person is able to either return to full REM sleep or to become fully awake,(more in the article but I didn't want the post to be too long.)  Thanks :-)

They drew a colored mark on the side of the dolphin and measured how stressed they were, as well as how they reacted. If they didn't think it was on them, they would ignore it or try to touch the mirror. Since they knew it was them, they would contort themselves to see it better and see it from different angles. Same way you would inspect something in a mirror.

__label__9 , whats u think about 1 night stand???????????????????,,If you're not already seeing someone and they're not already seeing someone, then there's probably no problem with it.  Just make sure to have protected sex as it would just be a slap in the face to get a disease from someone whom you'll never see again.  Some people have been in serious relationships and/or marriages that have ended in disaster, and can't bring themselves to get deeply involved with another person again.  A one-night stand or sex-buddy can often solve this problem but by doing this continually, you are denying the existance of your emotions, which may eventually cause problems.  So, I think I'd say that if you just want to have a few nights of fun before eventually settling down, then that's probably okay... just play safe and keep in touch with your feelings and listen to your gut instincts.

Australia seem to be testing players in certain positions.  In the spring/autumn test series they have shown players cannot play in certain positions.\n\n2. New Zealand seem to fall short of their postential in World Cups.  They won the first RWC, but have failed to win any others.  Some will say they were poisoned in South Africa in 1999, but there is no evidence of this.\n\n3. What stage of the tournament Australia meets New Zealand (Al Blacks).  If it is in a semi final, NZ may have peaked too early, and are starting to fade.\n\nFor Australia to beat New Zealand the three things above need to happen.\n1. Australia finds depth for their squad, especially in key areas.\n2 & 3. New Zealand peaks too early and the team is starting to fade for the semi finals.

__label__10 , Many libs are turning a blind eye to their party ?,In 1990, the House voted to reprimand Frank when it was revealed that Steve Gobie, a male prostitute that Rep. Frank had befriended after hiring him through a personal advertisement, claimed to have conducted a prostitution ring from Frank's apartment when he was not at home. Frank had dismissed Gobie earlier that year, and reported the incident to the House Ethics Committee, after learning of Gobie's activities.\nThe Boston Globe, among others, called on Frank to resign, but he refused. The House Ethics Committee recommended Frank be reprimanded because he reflected discredit upon the House by using his congressional office to fix 33 of Gobie's parking tickets. \nAnd why is this and Gerry Studds, McGreevy and other liberals highly worshipped?,Take a look at this:\n\nTop 10 Democratic Sex Scandals in Congress\n \nFound this list at Human Events Online\nWhat Rep. Foley did was evil immoral and reprehensible. I hope he is fully punished unlike the below listed Democrats.\nhttp://www.humanevents.com/lists.php?id=17357\n10. Sen. Daniel Inouye. The 82-year-old Hawaii Democrat was accused in the 1990s by numerous women of sexual harassment. Democrats cast doubt on the allegations and the Senate Ethics Committee dropped its investigation. \n9. Former Rep. Gus Savage. The Illinois Democrat was accused of fondling a Peace Corps volunteer in 1989 while on a trip to Africa. The House Ethics Committee decided against disciplinary action in 1990.\n8. Rep. Barney Frank. The outspoken Massachusetts Democrat hired a male prostitute who ran a prostitution service from Frank’s residence in the 1980s. Only two Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to censure him in 1990.\n7. Former Sen. Brock Adams. The late Washington Democrat was forced to stop campaigning after numerous accusations of drugging, assault and rape, the first surfacing in 1988.\n6. Former Rep. Fred Richmond. This New York Democrat was arrested in 1978 for soliciting sex from a 16-year-old. He remained in Congress and won re-election—before eventually resigning in 1982 after pleading guilty to tax evasion and drug possession.\n5. Former Rep. John Young. The late Texas Democrat increased the salary of a staffer after she gave in to his sexual advances. The congressman won re-election in 1976 but lost two years later. \n4. Former Rep. Wayne Hays. The late Ohio Democrat hired an unqualified secretary reportedly for sexual acts. Although he resigned from Congress, the Democratic House leadership stalled in removing him from the Administration Committee in 1976. \n3. Former Rep. Gerry Studds. He was censured for sexual relationship with underage male page in 1983. Massachusetts voters returned him to office for six more terms.\n2. Former Rep. Mel Reynolds. The Illinois Democrat was convicted of 12 counts of sexual assault with a 16-year-old. President Bill Clinton pardoned him before leaving office.\n1. Sen. Teddy Kennedy. The liberal Massachusetts senator testified in defense of nephew accused of rape, invoking his family history to win over the jury in 1991.\n\nSee the difference between the Republican Foley and these Democrats is that Foley was ostracized and resigned. These Democrats, including the ones you mentioned, were re-elected countless times and rewarded by the Democrats. And then there is Nancy Pelosi's support of the Man Boy Love Association.

Yoga Booty ballet?...,This really depends on what your goal is whether strength, endurance, power, speed, flexibility, weight-loss, weight-gain, etc.  You would need to define your goals before establishing a suitable exercise regimen.  You will find that there is not any best exercise program and incoporating several types of methodologies can help you meet goals.  Any exercise is better than no exercise, but it could very well be that the exercise you do enjoy and can stick with is one that is contrary to your goals, so you really have to set out what you want out of your fitness first before you define your exercise program.

There's a lot of talk out there about how great this Rutgers team is, how powerful Ray Rice is, how the defense doesn't give up any points.  And then you look at their schedule.  UNC, ILL, OHIO and Howard as a Non-Conference slate?  Also remember that Navy lost it's starting QB early in their game.  On the flip side, the Petrino knows that he has to win and win big to make up for his team's weak schedule compared to FLA, CAL, TEX & MICH.  The Cardinals have a pretty solid defense and an Offense that is clicking once again with Brohem at the controls.  Petrino puts his foot on the accelerator and doesn't look back.  Louisville, comfortably.
__label__10 , Show me the economic history of Nicaragua?,,Economic history of Nicaragua \n\nPre-Columbian and Colonial Era\nThe first Spanish explorers of Nicaragua found a welldeveloped agrarian society in the central highlands and Pacific lowlands. The rich volcanic soils produced a wide array of products, including beans, peppers, corn, cocoa, and cassava (manioc). Agricultural land was held communally, and each community had a central marketplace for trading and distributing food.\n\nThe arrival of the Spanish in the early 1500s destroyed, for all intents and purposes, the indigenous agricultural system. The early conquistadors were interested primarily in gold; European diseases and forced work in the gold mines decimated the native population. Some small areas continued to be cultivated at the end of the 1500s, but most previously tilled land reverted to jungle. By the early 1600s, cattle raising, along with small areas of corn and cocoa cultivation and forestry, had become the primary function of Nicaragua's land. Beef, hides, and tallow were the colony's principal exports for the next two and a half centuries.\n\n\nThe Coffee Boom, 1840s-1940s\nCoffee was the product that would change Nicaragua's economy. Coffee was first grown domestically as a curiosity in the early 1800s. In the late 1840s, however, as coffee's popularity grew in North America and Europe, commercial coffee growing began in the area around Managua. By the early 1850s, passengers crossing Nicaragua en route to California were served large quantities of Nicaraguan coffee. The Central American coffee boom was in full swing in Nicaragua by the 1870s, and large areas in western Nicaragua were cleared and planted with coffee trees.\n\nUnlike traditional cattle raising or subsistence farming, coffee production required significant capital and large pools of labor. Laws were therefore passed to encourage foreign investment and allow easy acquisition of land. The Subsidy Laws of 1879 and 1889 gave planters with large holdings a subsidy of US$0.05 per tree.\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, the entire economy came to resemble what is often referred to as a banana republic economy--one controlled by foreign interests and a small domestic elite oriented toward the production of a single agriculture export. Profits from coffee production flowed abroad or to the small number of landowners. Taxes on coffee were virtually nonexistent. The economy was also hostage to fluctuations in the price of coffee on the world markets--wide swings in coffee prices meant boom or bust years in Nicaragua.\n\n\nDiversification and Growth, 1945-77\nThe period after World War II was a time of economic diversification. The government brought in foreign technocrats to give advice on increasing production of new crops; hectarage in bananas and sugarcane increased, livestock herds grew, and cotton became a new export crop. The demand for cotton during the Korean War (1950-53) caused a rapid increase in cotton production, and by the mid-1950s, cotton was the nation's second largest export earner, after coffee.\n\nEconomic growth continued in the 1960s, largely as a result of industrialization. Under the stimulus of the newly formed Central American Common Market, Nicaragua achieved a certain degree of specialization in processed foods, chemicals, and metal manufacturing. By the end of the 1960s, however, import-substitution industrialization as a stimulus for economic growth had been exhausted. The 1969 Soccer War between Honduras and El Salvador, two members of the CACM, effectively suspended attempts at regional integration until 1987, when the Esquipulas II agreement was signed. By 1970 the industrial sector was undergoing little additional import substitution, and the collapse of the CACM meant that Nicaragua's economic growth, which had come from the expanding manufacturing sector, halted. Furthermore, the manufacturing firms that had developed under the tariff protection of the CACM were generally

__label__4 , Do today's youth grow up too fast or not fast enough?,Some college students graduate and either jump right into jobs or go back to school (could be putting off growing up a bit) and then jump right into jobs.  Are they rushing it or do they simply understand responsibility?  \nOthers graduate and keep their part time jobs, move back in with their parents and keep up their college ways.  Are they slacking or do they simply know how to experience and treasure their youth?    \nWhich is better?  What is a good compromise?,The answer to this question is YES.\n\nFirst, all the growth hormones we're pumping into food combined with the multiple generations of (fairly) good prenatal and childhood nutrition, children are physically maturing faster than ever.\n\nSimultaneously, as our life expectancy gets longer and longer, those children have longer to BE children before their brains point out that time is running out and they should be adults. It's widely accepted that Juliet in Romeo and Juliet would have been around 13 years old. But in a world where the average life expectancy was 30, she was already approaching middle age. Since middle age, now, is 40-50 years of age (if you assume that middle age is the part where you're about halfway through your years), then people don't feel the pressures of impending death until their 30s or 40s. Even if they think of death, they can just deny deny deny...  And many of us also have parents who helicopter and don't expect us to BE grown-up.\n\nBecause of this, children stay immature mentally and emotionally longer than ever before.\n\nThe part-timers who move in with their parents? They're slackers. And their parents are enabling that behavior. The ones who jump right in already understand that real life is NOW, it's not later, and they're doing what they have to do. Think of it this way: you're going to work your butt off, retire, and die. The only way to avoid this trap is to work hard enough when you're young to retire early enough to enjoy some of life. So the ones who jump right in have the right idea.

__label__1 , Relationships with partners who are not out and open?,I don't have anything particular in mind, just that my ex aggrivated me immensely because she would act like we were going out (holding hands, quick kisses, etc.) but if anyone asked her, she would deny that she was attracted to girls and tell them that I was just barking up the wrong tree.  She wouldn't even tell people be both knew were Kinsey2s or higher that she liked girls, and I don't understand that at all.  Of course if you're not sure how someone will take it, excercise caution, but if you know they're gay, why not gain an ally, as it were?  Also, a current very good friend of mine who I am almost sure is a K6 (maybe a 5) lists her preference as straight on myspace and won't let me post anything that makes her sound gay.  Don't these girls realize that there is as much support as hatred out there if you know where to look?  Why are they ashamed of who they are?  Lastly - is dating someone like this a good idea?,OMG my x did the same exact thing to me.  My x broke up with me, but she will still hug and kiss me.  Like she keeps reeling me back in.  Confusing i know.  When we were first going out she made it quite clear that she could never come out to her parents.  Then a few days ago she says that she is really only 20% gay.  What a slam in the face to me.  She won't accept anything of who she is.  Maybe she believes that denying the truth will make her life easier. I really don't know if dating someone like this is a great idea, but it depends on how much you care for them.  I still love my x a lot and if she wanted to get back together i would be all for it, but at the same time i don't get the full benefits of a healthy relationship.  The only quetion you need to ask is if the good out weighs the bad.  Do you still enjoy being around her?  If her denial is upsetting you that much then maybe it is better to break it off, but if you still seriously care for her, then it makes it a little more difficult to just let go.

Then we talked about what they thought about moving, well at least what my 15 yr old thought.  Then we made the decision to move as a family.  We waited until summer and moved a few weeks after school was out.  That gave him time to learn the new area and make some new friends.\n\nThis move was only for 2 years, my husband was active duty military.  The town was terrible, the school was worse.  I eneded up home schooling my son, until we could move back home.  He hated the place and we did have some decipline problems, that promptly went away when we moved back home.\n\nBut we got through it, I am happliy married and he starts college in the fall, on a scholarship.\n\nMake sure your daughter knows that you will not move if she really doesn't want to, but also tell her your reasons.\n\nI guess the moral to the story is, make the decision as a family and then you have to live with the results.

__label__2 , what is a blackhole?,,A black hole is a concentration of mass great enough that the force of gravity prevents anything from escaping it except through quantum tunneling behavior (known as Hawking Radiation). The gravitational field is so strong that the escape velocity near it exceeds the speed of light. This implies that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravity, hence the word black. The term black hole is widespread, even though it does not refer to a hole in the usual sense, but rather a region of space from which nothing can return.

__label__1 , Why does idiot stick Pat Robertson still claim he can leg press 2,000 pounds without offering proof?,,I don't think he is an idiot. I don't think that he is telling the truth though. I think the idiots who believe him and buy his energy drink are the idiots. Anyone who believes that a 76 year old man could lift that much are the proverbial fools who will be parted from their money.\n\nFor comparative purposes, when Dan Kendra set the Florida State University record of 1,335 pounds, the leg press machine required extensive modifications to hold the proper amount of weight, and the capillaries in both of Kendra's eyes burst during his successful attempt. Thus, Robertson's claimed achievement would add 665 pounds to the best-ever total of Kendra, a top athlete in his physical prime, who would go on to play professional football in the National Football League and become a Navy SEAL.\n\nIn response to the skepticism of this claim, Robertson's website has claimed that his doctor is able to leg press 2,700 pounds, and that It is not nearly as hard as the authors of these reports make it out to be.(What these reports are exactly was not specified).\n\nA video has also been provided supposedly demonstrating Robertson doing several reps with a weight of 1,000 pounds which can be seen here. In the video Pat Robertson is seen using a 45 degree sled type leg press machine. He keeps the safety locks in place at the second step which severely limits the range of possible motion. The seat is positioned to allow approximately six inches of travel after the lock. This setup gives Pat Robertson the maximum mechanical advantage at the last few inches of travel. This is generally regarded to be improper leg press technique. The proper technique is to load the weight, place hands on the release levers and then to press the weight from the stops and then to rotate the stops out. Then, the weight is allowed to slide down until the quads and glutes are at full extension. At this point, the person executing the leg press has minimal mechanical advantage and can press the least amount of weight. In the video, Robertson also appears to be using his arms to push on his thighs, which is also regarded as improper technique.\n\nIn June 2006, General Nutrition Center, a nutritional supplement retailer, announced without explanation that it would stop carrying Robertson's energy drink.

__label__2 , Physics question below?,A rotating door is made from four rectangular glass panes, the width of each rectangular glass pane is 1.2 m. The mass of each pane is 78 kg. A person pushes on the outer edge of one pane with a force of F = 66 N that is directed perpendicular to the pane. Determine the magnitude of the door's angular acceleration.,Treat this problem as a point source of mass on a massless arm.\nMass (m) = 4 * 78 kg = 312 kg\nArm length (radius, r) = 1.2 m\nForce (F) = 66 N\n\nMoment of inertia = m*r^2 (kg-m^2) = 312 * 1.2 * 1.2 = 449.28 kg-m^2\n\nFrom Wikipedia; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia:\nThe (scalar) moment of inertia of a point mass rotating about a known axis is defined by\n    I = m * r^2\nwhere,\n    m is its mass,\n    and r is its perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation.\n\nAngular acceleration (α)= τ/I = (F * m)/I = (66 * 1.2)/ 449.28 = 0.176 rad/sec^2\n\nFrom Wikipedia; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_acceleration\n   α = τ/I (rad/sec^2)\nwhere,\n   τ is torque\n   I is moment of inertia. \n\nHope this helps!

__label__4 , Can you have a Stafford Loan coming from more than one place for college?,,You can use a different lender from year to year.  For example, you can obtain your Freshman year Stafford Loan from Citizens Bank and your Sophomore year Stafford Loan from Citibank.  You will find that this is a little bit of a pain since it will entail completing a new Master Promissory Note for each lender (and might confuse your school a little bit if they are expecting you to borrow from once place and you go elsewhere).  \n\nHaving multiple lenders can benefit you, though, if you plan on consolidating later. See, students who borrow every single student loan from the same lender are bound by something known as the single holder rule. Simply put, this rule states that a students with loans help by a single lender *must* consolidate with that lender.  So, if all your loans are with Citibank, you must consolidate with Citibank, even if Sallie Mae is offering better borrower benefits.\n\nNow, you probably shouldn't attempt to borrow from two Stafford lenders during the same enrollment period at the same school (for example, if you were awarded $3,500 as a Sophomore, you shouldn't attempt to borrow $1,750 from Citibank and $1,750 from Sallie Mae). While this isn't expressly forbidden, it's... well, weird and could cause a big mess (you could be responsible for an overpayment, your loan disbursements could be delayed, etc.). \n\nKeep in mind that interest rates on Stafford Loans are set by the federal government, so your underlying interest rates on any Staffords will be the same. The only reason you'd want to shop around would be to obtain one of the many borrower benefits out there for student loan borrowers (interest rate reductions, principal reductions, etc.).  However, it's unlikely that one bank will offer a benefit that's enormously better than another bank's benefit (the borrower benefits will be different, yes, but in the end, they tend to add up to similar savings).  \n\nFor more information about borrower benefits and about the single holder rule, which is still in effect, check out these pages:\n\nhttp://www.finaid.org/loans/singleholderrule.phtml\nhttp://www.finaid.org/loans/choosing.phtml\nhttp://www.finaid.org/calculators/loananalyzer.phtml

Adding a catalyst.\n\n2. Adding a positive catalyst.\n\n3. Adding a negative catalyst.\n\n4. Using high pressure.\n\n5. Using low pressure.\n\n6. Using high temperature.\n\n7. Using low temperature.\n\nWill the same thing happen for an endothermic reversible reaction?\n\nThanks! Answer plz! Any related website url will also help! Its very important!,1. adding a catalyst does not change the equilibrium. it simply speeds up the rate at which equilibrium is reached.\n\n4. there is a higher pressure on the LHS than on the RHS ( 3 molecules as compared to 2 molecules). using le chatelier's principle if pressure is inc. equilibrium will try to reduce the pressure and forward rctn takes place.\n\n5. opposite of 4. backwards rctn takes place.\n\n6. if the forward rctn. is exothermic the equilibrium will shift to the reaction which absorbs heat thus cooling down the system. so the endothermic reaction, in this case the backwards rctn will take place.\n\n7. opposite of 6. forward rctn takes place.\n\nif the forward reaction is endothermic 6 and 7 would change

Never give a guy money (there is a difference if you are seriously dating someone and you pay for a date or two) and try not to sleep with a guy right off the bat. You need to find yourself and love you whether you have a boyfriend or not. And I seriously hope you are not over 30 and saying these things. I hope you are a teenager and know nothing about life yet. Cause the right person will come along one day and it might not be for a long time. Enjoy life and when that person comes along you will really be able to love them back since you love yourself. You need to cheer up, take care of yourself, and do something right now that makes you happy. Good luck.

They may stay in the kidney or travel out of the body through the urinary tract—the tubes that connect the kidney to the bladder (ureters) and lead outside the body (urethra). When traveling through the urinary tract, a stone may cause no pain or cause great pain and other symptoms. Kidney stones usually do not cause any long-term damage to the urinary tract.

In a traditional class, the teacher uses the board most of the time.  The Montessori approach uses activities.

But the common observation is their difficulty in adjusting initially to the new setting of the traditional method.

I'd bet anything that Nixon thought Lennon was 'subversive' he was so paranoid!,Hoover had files on practically everybody.  He considered everybody to be a potential communist.

__label__2 , How Does Smoking Affect Us?,,You've already been told of the physical effects. Now, get a hold of the emotional ones. Someone who dies from the effects of smoking needlessly leaves behind loved ones to mourn. My sister smoked heavily for years, she died 4 years ago and left 3 young adult children who'd already lost their father when they were teens. She now has beautiful grandchildren she will never see. It is slow suicide and is intrusive to others who suffer from asthma and allergies. Second hand smoke is just as dangerous. Just butt out while you still can!

The coleslaw I looked up and had 22 grams.. which is pretty equivalent to a piece of bread. But\ndon't get upset, or feel like a failure, because that will only lead you to get off your diet.. some people have off days, and eat something they shouldn't when on a diet.. but don't let it discourage you..If you feel real guilty the best thing you can do after eating carbs is go for a walk and burn some of it off..  \nThe best way to lose weight though, is to find a diet that you can live with for the rest of your life, and usually that isn't a low carb diet.. maybe cut down your calories to 1000-1200 a day, and make Sunday a cheat day, where you can eat anything you want.. remember, sometimes its not the food you eat, but the portions you take.. \nGood Luck..

__label__1 , Do teachers have all your records like where you were born , your complete name and your age??,What are the limits they have ???,your complete name - yes\nyour age - if you are still in HS, then yes.  Maybe not if you are in college\nyour place of birth - probably not... this is not a common question on enrollment applications\n\nWhen you are in college (which I'm going to assume you are not, by the question) your professors only really care about the following personal information: Name, student number, school email address.  Everything else is handled by the registrar, and the profs don't really need to see it.\n\nWhen you are a minor, your teachers will have access to your name, birth date, student number, and possibly your parents address (in the event that your parents have to be notified about your behavior or something), any medical or food allergies that you might have, and any learning disabilities that you might have.  The administration office will also have records that include an emergency phone number and contact persons (usually your parents).  All of this information about you is kept safe , and is only shared with those employees of the school district that are responsible for keeping you safe and your family informed. (So, your home address isn't floating around the student body unless you share the information.)\n\nBy looking at your other recent questions, however, I get the feeling that you are asking this in hopes of deceiving your hot teacher into believing that you are of consenting age to have a relationship with him.  Just don't.  Regardless of how fabulous you are, or how much you like him, a relationship between a teacher and a student is strictly illegal.  You are basically asking over and over again how you can ruin this man's future.  If you really do like him and care about him, please put all thoughts of a relationship with him out of your head.  It's okay to fantasize, but it's better to move on and seek a relationship with someone who is actually available.

__label__6 , Best barrel length for slug hunting?,I have opportunity to hunt with a mossberg 930 \n3-inch slug.\n\n The problem is I have a choice of a rifled 18 or 24 barrel. What are the true differences between the two barrels as far as velocity and accuracy? NOT just opinion please. \n\nI want to also use this shotgun as home protection and the fact that it is rifled barrel is not a problem for home defense, the pattern does not matter when im shooting 10 feet. \n\nI understand it is a weird question put can you guys help.,If you want to know the true difference between the two, it's a simple answer, there is none. No I'm not crazy, velocity and accuracy is determined in the last  2 1/2 of your barrel. It's called the choke, you can purchase a shotgun with a number of different chokes as in ( Full , Modified, semi Modified, to Improved cylinder) I have five different interchangeable chokes for my Browning over/under and each have there purpose.\n\nBeing that both barrels have rifling the only difference you will notice between the two barrels would be the the recoil will be some what greater on the 18 barrel, and the 24 will get you 6closer to your target.\n\nRange of the gun is determined by the slug and the drams of powder in the slug. You will notice that when you purchase slugs they are already state Magnum load on the box as well as size 2 3/4 or 3 shells.\n\nThis isn' t brag cause Ive never done it but I watched my Dad with his model 1100 Remington with a 26 barrel with modified choke and 2 3/4 slug split penny post cards at 100 yds.

__label__6 , team help on b-ball?,im trying out for a team and i need somoene 2 answer these questions\n\n1. do coaches look for offence or defenceive player who are 5 foot 3\n\n2. how  to improve ur jump shot\n\n3. does back spin realy help ur shot\n\n4. any good tips on getting a better ##% shot\n\n5. any good drills that i can do at home with only a b-ball and a hoop\n\n6. any good tips on def and gaurding,well it partly depends on what grade ur in.. if 8th grade or soemthing 5'3 is fine, but if hs.. then it might get a lil tricky..\n\nok but watever. coaches may judge height, but they mostly look for skill (both defense AND offense). they usually tend to look more at offense, even though some claim that defense is most important. the reason for this is that it is harder to look good at defense than it is at offense (good defense = opponent not being able to score.. but its less obvious and less breathtaking than someone making a 3 or dunkin the ball, etc)\n\njump shot-- u need proper form first.. then practice for a while.. competitive practice is the best, try playing ur friends (who have decent defense) proper form = when u lift ur arm, ur elbow is at 90 degree angle.. always hold ur follow thru\n\nspin does indeed help ur shot, but u shouldnt really worry about that. spin comes naturally once ur get ur shot right \n\nto get better shot, work on ur triceps (work out). working out throws off ur shot, but once u practice and get it back its worth it. also, try to shoot under pressure with a friend as well\n\nsome of my favorite drills that i have done to become a great defender are = towel jump, lunges, and just jumping as high as u can. a bball and a hoop is really all u need for offense.. practice layups.. not just ordinary ones, but jump stop layups.. layups at full speed. and also work on both hands\n\nfor guarding, explosive side to side movements are ESSENTIAL. as i said before jumping and towel jump will help this greatly (towel jump = place towel on floor and jump side to side of it\n\nalrite good luck
__label__9 , What is common law marriage in the state of Texas?,She does not use my last name however, we live together and have been for the past 3yrs. Both of our names are on a car loan, and the townhome we live in.  Does this mean we are common law married. We live in Dickinson, Texas.,Not necessarily.  In Texas there are two way in which you can prove an ‘informal’ marriage (which is what Texas calls a common-law marriage)\n\n1--a declaration of the marriage has been signed (yes, in Texas you can actually record a declaration of informal marriage with the county clerk)\n\nOR \n\n2--the man and woman agreed to be married and after the agreement they lived together in this state as husband and wife and there represented to others that they were married.\n\nSo have you AGREED to be married and REPRESENTED yourselves as married?  Just both of your names being on a loan does not mean you agreed to be married or you've held yourself out to be husband and wife.  Do you or have you referred to each other as husband and wife?  Have you filed your tax returns as 'married’?  \n\nIt sounds like you're still together.  If you intend to remain together then why not file the declaration of informal marriage?  Or just get married?
__label__7 , What is the difference between sponsorship and advertising?,,Advertising pays to have a product presented to the public. Sponsorship pays the entire cost, or contributes towards the cost of an event. Usually, the sponsor requests that their product be prominently displayed in return for their sponsorship. The public display, or advertising of the product, is a direct benefit returned from the sponsoring the event.
__label__2 , How can gravity exist in the space ships in Star Wars?,,Presuming you mean real space ships operating in a zero-gravity environment and not just fake spaceships on a film set?  Funkymonk is right, gentle accelleration followed by a turn-over mid trip and an equal dceleration would create a sensation of 'gravity' through the soles of the feet.\n\nAlternatively, in (say) a orbital space station, the interplay of centripetal and centrifugal forces created by spinning a structure, with its occupants, about its axis much like in the opening sequences of the film 2001, will create a sensation of gravity (tricky concept, very hard to understand ... serious maths involved) .  A large diameter structure spinning slowly would produce the best effect.\n\nMuscle wasting resulting from long periods in zero gravity is a major impediment to long space journeys, the gravity problem is one that needs to be resolved so that cosmonaughts can survive back in earth gravity once they return.

__label__8 , Who would win in a fight Kitty Pride or Sue Storm, also Colossus and The Thing?,In the fight between the females its dark, in a small city not too many allet ways.\n\n\nIn the fight between the men theyre in the desert theres been sandstroms all day.,I don't know whether Kitty could go through Sue's force field. If she can't, Sue wins by default, just trap her in a bubble. If she is able to go through the force fields, Sue's in big trouble. Sue could fill the space around her with invisible force fields, so that Kitty wouldn't be able to solidify to attack her w/o harming herself. (I'm quite sure that Kitty can't selectively solidify one limb at a time, oslt.) But it would come down to a matter of timing, before they each were able to figure out each others' strengths and weaknesses.\n\nColossus vs. Thing is more difficult. Go to Marvel Directory and look up both of them, to see who is more powerful, strength wise. I'm inclined to say Ben Grimm will win. He is wiser, more mature and level headed.  Even if Colossus is stronger, Ben still has a good shot. He could talk the kid down. I just don't see Piotr as being so enraged that he would be willing to keep on attacking someone who was in his weight class and didn't want to fight. Ben would offer to buy them a round of beers, like he did with the Sandman. He knows how to turn an enemy into a friend.\n\n20 NOV 06, 1318 hrs, GMT.

__label__8 , what is eclectic pop?,,The Eclectic Pop of Escape Pod\n \nESCAPE POD: Losing Control (7-inch Single on Dead Digital)\n\nThis single from 2003 offers an all too-brief dose of eclectic pop.\n\nCombining raw electronics and low-fi folk sensibilities, Escape Pod generates a sound that is haunting but reassuring. The minimal electronics are finely restrained to the point where the sparseness creates a lusher sound than the components, a flow expertly embellished by the vocal harmonies that describe unrequited wishes. Sedate drums and gentle guitar flesh out the compositions, delivering the ethereal sound into more accessible territory.\n\nComparable to the Pixies and Beck, Escape Pod's music provides a serene access to tuneage of less demanding quality, providing sonic refuge among airwaves overcrowded with harsh noise.

__label__1 , Information on Buddhism's 1st noble truth?,Why does it focus on alleviating suffering? What exactly does it mean by suffering? Do you know any extra information?,The Buddha's discovery of the solution to the problem of suffering began with the recognition that life is suffering. This is the first of the Four Noble Truths. If people examine their own experiences or look at the world around them, they will see that life is full of suffering. Suffering may be Physical or Mental.\nPhysical Suffering\nPhysical suffering takes many forms. People must have observed at one time or another, how their aged relatives suffer. Most of the aged suffer aches and pains in their joints and many find it hard to move about by themselves. With advancing age, the lderlyfind life difficult because they cannot see, hear or eat properly. The pain of disease, which strikes young and old alike, is unbearable, and the pain of death brings much grief and suffering. Even the moment of birth gives pain both to the mother and to the child that is born.\nThe truth is that suffering of birth, old age, sickness and death is unavoidable. Some fortunate people may now be enjoying relatively happy and carefree lives, but it is only a matter of time before they, too, will experience suffering. What is worse, this suffering must be born alone.\nMental Suffering\nBeside physical suffering, there are also various forms of mental suffering. People feel sad, lonely or depressed when they lose someone they love through separation or death. They feel irritated or uncomfortable when they are forced to be company of those whom they dislike or those who are unpleasant. People also suffer when they unable to satisfy their limitless needs and wants.\nHappiness in Life \nWhen the Buddha said that there is suffering in life, he did not deny that there is happiness also. On the contrary, he spoke of many kinds of happiness such as the happiness of friendship, the happiness of family life, and so on. But all these kinds of happiness are impermanent and when one loses them, one suffers. For example, one may like a pleasant and charming person and enjoy his or her company. But when one is separated from that person, the happiness turns into suffering. One suffers because of one's attachment to pleasures that do not last.\nPeople often remain unaware of the inevitable sufferings of life because they are distracted by temporary pleasures.
__label__6 , what is average speed for woman racebicycling?,i ment about speed that woman can achieve during bicycle race and average speed,faster than 15 km for sure. i ride with a bike club that rides consistently around 20 miles an hour, and there are many women who ride. i'd definitely imagine a road race for women would be able to consistently hold above 6. whatever miles an hour 15 km/h equals. Me and several friends of mine (including girls) averaged much faster than that on mountain climbs in colorado.\n\nas for speeds they can achieve, if its in the mountains, going down it would easily be in excess of 50 miles an hour.

__label__3 , if my hcg was 122 on fri. and now 993 today , that is more than doubling right? Does it sound like multiples o,or do i just have lots of hormones,The Doubling Rule.\nDoctors can also perform quantitative serum beta hCG levels. The measurement is done in mIU/ml, and a level above 25 mIU/ml usually indicates the presence of a pregnancy. Two tests are usually necessary to verify a normal increase, usually 2-3 days apart. The increase in serum hCG can be interactively monitored. Below an hCG level of 1,200 mIU/ml the hCG usually doubles every 48-72 hours, though a rise of 50-60% is still considered normal. Between 1,200 and 6,000 mIU/ml serum the hCG usually takes 72-96 hours to double, and above 6,000 mIU/ml, the hCG often takes more than four days to double. Failure to increase normally may indicate that the pregnancy is not developing well and can be an early sign for a possible miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy.

__label__2 , why does hot water clean better than cold water?,,First, this is a chemistry question, not biology.\n\nSecond, any solvent can hold more in suspension when it is hot.  Basically, hot water can dissolve more detergent, and more detergent can pick up more dirt particles.\n\nThird, any substance like oil or grease will have a lower viscosity at higher temperature and therefore flow more freely. This will allow the water to rinse it away more easily, independent of detergent. That's why you run hot water to rinse greasy pans; otherwise, the grease would tend to accumulate in the drain pipes and cause a clog.\n\nNOTE: If your question is about sterilization, only water above 180 degrees Farenheit will do the trick.

__label__9 , How do you go on after a breakup?,A 37 year old married man and I, 21, are very much in love. We began a relationship together when he asked if i would be interested in having some fun with he and his wife. i had been curious about being with a woman and said yes for the experience. after 3 months i lost total respect from my family and moved out and into the couples home temporarily in which i became part of the family. The fun slowed down and the wife started bowing out of the relationship leaving only the man and I to bond closer and closer as best friends and lovers. After 10 months I told him that I couldnt continue to be lovers with him. He and his wife had problems before me and they had worsened and i felt very much in the way of their progress towards working things out. He and I had talked about marriage and family in our future if things didnt work out between he and his wife. I dont know how to go on continuing a friendship with him with out hurting so much. He and I still love eachother very much.,I think you need to escape from this mire as soon as possible. Look after yourself and leave this man and is wife to sort themselves out. Perhaps you need to address some personal issues of your own .. most people would not give a second thought about avoiding such a minefield in the first place... good luck.
__label__9 , Does she like me? Or are we friends?,I just graduated college, and today I got this message on Facebook from a girl that I was friends with. She said she wishes me the best for the future and misses me. While we were in college we had to work alone on a project several times. During this time, we came to be fairly good friends. I would often walk her back to where we parted toward our own apartments. A lot of flirtation went on between us, but she and I never admitted probably because our social group does not date much. We see each other as brother and sister, and so she calls me her brother. But why the heck does she miss me? Nobody else has written me anything. Are we good friends, or are we more than friends? If you need more info, let me know. Thanks!,First off, do you know if she's single or seeing someone right now? She could just miss you as a good friend, what I think you should do is ask her yourself. Either get her number or meet with her if you're in the same area. Do it casually, don't make it seem like a big deal. Just reminisce about old times and casually bring up your relationship back then. Ask her if she ever thought of you as maybe more than a friend or if there was ever a possibility of there being more between you two. The worst that she could say is you're just a friend, and you'll never be satisfied until you find out for sure. Trust me, I'm learning the hard way. Hope this helps a little.
__label__2 , Was Jupiter once a micro solar system captured by our own bigger solar system?,Imagen a small solar system (Jupiter a sun with its own small planets) crossing our path and captured by our suns gravitational pull.and is drained our burns out quickly.,Jupiter, while larger than all the other planets in our system put together, is still far too small to have ever been a star in its own rights. Furthermore, stars don't just burn out. Depending on thier mass, they can undergo a number of different evolutions; many will go super-nova, spewing out unimaginable ammounts of heavy atoms and radiation, others will diminish into brown or whites dwaves, still others will form black holes. \n\nIt might be possible (though incredibly unlikely) for a solar system to ensnare passing planetoids, but they would be unlikely to form stable orbits in the time that our solar system has been around.\n\nIt's an interesting idea, and although jupiter could never have been a star, it is proponderously unlikely, but not impossible, that it could have originated outside of our solar system.

__label__4 , Why is it when you go into an 80 degree bath it's cold but when it is 80 degrees outside you are warm?,,It mainly has to do with how fast your body gets rid of heat to the surrounding medium. Water can whisk heat away from your body nearly four times faster than air, so it feels cooler to your body. Also, a factor with air is going to be humidity. The more humidity in the air, the less sweat evaporating from you skin and thus the hotter (and stickier) it feels.

__label__2 , I have heard that Strattera and Wellbutrin do not work well together. Why is this?,Does it cause physical harm?  Or something simpler like reducing the effects of each other?  As deep as you understand it, how does this happen between the chemistry of the two and the biology of the human mind?,The answer lies in the mechanism of action of the two medications.  \n\nAtomoxetine (Strattera) is a norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor inhibitor that acts almost exclusively on the noradrenergic pathway.\n\nBupropion (Wellbutrin) inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin neurotransmission.\n\nSo as you can see the medications act on similiar mechanism and therefore taking them both would be like overdosing on either.  Wellbutrin can also promote seizure which is dose related too.\n\nIn sum, taking them together could be dangerous.

__label__7 , What are the best ways to make my money work for me such as investing in stock or anything else.?,I am 18 going to college full time and I was recently promoted to assistant store manager. I've got roughly $600 a week to screw around with. I dont have a lot of time to invest into anything but was looking for help with investing in stock possibly. Thanks,I'd recommend holding off on the stocks until you build some diversification with your investments.  Try to build a nest egg of about $20K in mutual funds... trust me, you'll sleep better at night and not worry about a single stock plummeting on you.  Once you have that foundation of mutual funds, invest in one stock at a time... perhaps a $2000 total investment per purchase.  Buy three stocks... that's $6,000 total, etc.  Whatever numbers you decide are best for you, start with a solid foundation of mutual funds.... because here's the fun part: as you buy individual stocks as I suggested, eventually you'll own 50 stocks or more... that's your own mini-mutual fund that you've created!  Be sure your stocks are diversified... don't put all your money into stocks in the same industry.  Spread your money around... you'll be glad you did.  Good luck.

Some places like Ohio still have record high unemployment rates.\n\n2/  Standard of living...it is more expensive to live in the major ruban centers such as NY, Boston, D.C. etc Expect to pay as much as 40% of your net income to housing in these areas.\n\n3/ Personal interests....what do you like to do? Each city is different....if you like a great nightlife, then choose a major city. If you have a family or like a more quit life, then look for an suburb. \n\n4/ Do you have family & friends in the U.S.? Living near them would help with the isolation and intergration into American life...\n\n5/  Your race/religion...you may want to avoid areas that are already notorious

__label__10 , how can i become a union city police officer?,,NJ??  Take the civil service exam if they hire off that list.  You can get an application for the exam at your library although I think the filing deadline for this year has already passed.  You can go to one of the precincts and ask how they hire.  If they use a chief's test you'll probably have to know somebody in order to get on.  Good luck.
__label__10 , Why do we need labor unions?,I mean come on, if you don't like your job, get the f* out.  Do I need to show you where the door is?,As they exist today...we don't.  Unions were not meant to be and should not be permanent organizations.\n\nThe truth is that what labor unions were originally is very different from the large corporate unions of today.  When unions got started the scenario went something like this:\n\nA group of workers in a weaving factory are concerned about getting thier hair caught in the machines, which is in fact a distinct possibility.  They have mentioned this danger to thier supervisor, but nothing is done to make the workers safer.  \n\nOne day a twelve year old female worker does get her hair caught in the machines and is nearly scalped before the woman on the loom next to hers can get the machine to stop.  The supervisor orders the workers to keep working and sends for the doctor while the girl bleeds onto the floor.  The doctors do the best they can, but the girl dies.\n\nThe workers beg thier supervisor to see that changes are made, but nothing happens. The workers get together and decide to strike until the factory owner makes the machines safer thus forming a union. The strike causes production to significantly drop and the factory owner decides to fix the machines in order to save his business.  Once the machines are in working order, the women go to work and the union disbands. \n\nToday, unions are permanent, powerful, politically active, big money organizations who often act contrary to workers interests.  This is the problem.
__label__8 , Which Digital Piano Sound Best (Feels like a real grand acoustic piano) ?,Is it Previa by Casio, Kawai Digital, or Clavinova By Yamaha ? or any other ?,It's a matter of personal preference. (and of course nothing beats a real piano.) But Digital pianos are easier to maintain. I suggest going to the store and playing all these models. I personally like Yamaha. I'd stay away from Casio. Don't know much about Kawai. Kurzweill and Korg have some of the leading technologies as far as sounding like a piano is concerned. You'll want something truly weighted to feel like a grand piano.

__label__10 , Who made Mothers' Day an official holiday?,,The Story of Mother's Day\n\nThe earliest Mother's Day celebrations can be traced back to the spring celebrations of ancient Greece in honor of Rhea, the Mother of the Gods. During the 1600's, England celebrated a day called Mothering Sunday. Celebrated on the 4th Sunday of Lent (the 40 day period leading up to Easter*), Mothering Sunday honored the mothers of England. \n*(For more information on Lent/Easter check out - Easter on the Net)\nDuring this time many of the England's poor worked as servants for the wealthy. As most jobs were located far from their homes, the servants would live at the houses of their employers. On Mothering Sunday the servants would have the day off and were encouraged to return home and spend the day with their mothers. A special cake, called the mothering cake, was often brought along to provide a festive touch. \n\n\nAs Christianity spread throughout Europe the celebration changed to honor the Mother Church - the spiritual power that gave them life and protected them from harm. Over time the church festival blended with the Mothering Sunday celebration . People began honoring their mothers as well as the church.\n\nIn the United States Mother's Day was first suggested in 1872 by Julia Ward Howe (who wrote the words to the Battle hymn of the Republic) as a day dedicated to peace. Ms. Howe would hold organized Mother's Day meetings in Boston, Mass ever year. \n\nIn 1907 Ana Jarvis, from Philadelphia, began a campaign to establish a national Mother's Day. Ms. Jarvis persuaded her mother's church in Grafton, West Virginia to celebrate Mother's Day on the second anniversary of her mother's death, the 2nd Sunday of May. By the next year Mother's Day was also celebrated in Philadelphia.\n\nMs. Jarvis and her supporters began to write to ministers, businessman, and politicians in their quest to establish a national Mother's Day. It was successful as by 1911 Mother's Day was celebrated in almost every state. President Woodrow Wilson, in 1914, made the official announcement proclaiming Mother's Day as a national holiday that was to be held each year on the 2nd Sunday of May. \n\nWhile many countries of the world celebrate their own Mother's Day at different times throughout the year, there are some countries such as Denmark, Finland, Italy, Turkey, Australia, and Belgium which also celebrate Mother's Day on the second Sunday of May.\n\n\nI hope this helps....\n\nDon

__label__9 , What to do with a schizophrenic friend??,I have a friend who i've known since I was 14. I'm 26 now. A year ago he ended up in the psych ward at the hospital. All of his friends abandoned him, his father died when he was 9 and his mom has mental issues of her own. He lives in a tiny 1 room apt. now, no t.v, no radio, nothing except a bible. I run into him sometimes and feel guilty. I've visited him and called a few times, but I never know what to say. And now that I know he's been diagnosed as schizophrenic, my other friends tell me to just forget about him. But that's not me. What would you do??,PERSONAL EXPERIANCE HAS TUAGHT ME ONE THING\nseeing your friends go trhough a downward spiral is no easy task...but\n\nFirst And Foremost You need to ask YOURSLEF a serious qeustion.. \n\nAre you considering it to actually help him out, and i mean REALLY help him out? or are you wanting to help your freind because you feel guilty about not helping him? \n\nYes i am being serious...and yes they are two COMPLETELY different things.... either you want to help him out becuase you feel as though you have a responsibillity as a person of society to help him with his ordeal, OR you want to make YOURSELF feel better, and get the moral dilema off your concious....\n\nThe reason this quesiton is important, is that it will do more damage to him if, when it gets difficult and time/money consuming (and it WILL), that you find that its not worth spending months/ years devoted to helping him trhough the ordeal, and fade out of his life. \n\nIf you have read this, thought about it, and really thought about it, and still have in mind to help him, i'd say just be the freind that you are, becuase a person who would be willing to do the above knowing the sacrifices one would have to make wouldn't need to do anything else to help your friend out in his hard times.

__label__9 , Calling all large families whose parents are in their 20s to 40s.........?,How do you afford a large family? How much do you spend a month on groceries, supplies, schooling, etc? My husband and I want 4 kids but we aren't sure if we can afford it. He is about to start a new job. In 2 years he will make $16 an hour while I will make about $9 an hour with a home daycare. Do you think we could make it fine with 4 kids (they will be adopted as we can't have any on our own and they would all be homeschooled)? For the next 5 years we will have 2 car payments and a personal loan all $215 or more. I am just looking for opinions about your family and how you make it. Do you think we could afford more children like 5 or 6?,I'm a 33 years old. My husband is 33 we both work a full time job and we have 5 children from age 4-13. My husband and I have been married for almost 11 years. Together we have a home of our own, 2 vehicles, and any and every thing else the children might want they usually get depending on behavior. We spend almost $600 a month on groceries and cleaning supplies. The hardest time of year for us is of course Christmas and the beginning of the school year. But we always manage to do very well anyway.I believe that if you have enough love to give to 4 children that aren't even yours then you will make it.

Be careful and not to overextend yourself.  Your grades are important and being a tutor is a great way to help others and keep your academic edge.  Also, working with the professors on projects.  It is better to be good at a couple of things than to be so spread out you are not good at anything.  Have one activity where you are in charge.  You will gain a lot from that experience.
__label__9 , Does it put men off if a girl wont go down on them?,I have a point that I will not give oral sex to a man cause I think its degrading, also I dont know how. Does that put men off if you wont go down on them?,If the guy is decent, cares about you and wants a relationship with you and not just sex, then NO it will not put him off. \n\nI actually understand when you say you think it's degrading- I have also felt like that before, when i was with someone who used to get me to do it all the time. It felt very degrading, like he was just getting an ego trip off it. I really struggle with it now, I very rarely feel comfortable doing it although I hope this changes eventually...\n\nI do think though, that if you can build up a really great trusting and comfortable sexual relationship, you'll probably get over it and start feeling differently. As for technique, ask him to demonstrate how he likes it by sucking your fingers! That'll give you an idea of what to do. But even if you never come round to the idea, that's your deicision and don't let anyone tell you you're wrong.

Also we need someway for him to push the gas and break. I thought this was so cute and sweet. I love having kids. These are the moments I will never forget. Or let him forget.,Someday,  You can be a proud mom with your son actually in the military.  I think it is one of the best things a young man or woman can do as they prepare for life.  I remind my soldiers that they need to recognize that the military is one step on the part of life and that it is only part of who they will be in the future.  The military teaches discipline and gives confidence to young adults. I once heard that if you could give your children one thing, it shoul be confidence, because with it all else is possible--education, money, love, success. \nThat said, couple confidence with discipline, and you have success.  Finally, yes the Army Trucks M915, M916 and HETS have room for him and you.  And oh by the way, we have McDonald,s, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Charley's Steak, Taco Bell and Other Fast Food Restaurants on our base camps and I know --because I am at war here in Iraq as we speak.

I want to lose 20lbs, but I think that will be highly inlikely to do within the next month.  So any suggestions for me that I can use so I look sexy on the beach this summer?,First of all, you are tall, so you can carry more weight.  Do you really think you need to lose 20 lbs?  You are correct that one month is not enough time to lose 20 lbs in a healthy way.  \n\nInstead, try this:  Start a well-rounded fitness program.  \nWalk first, then maybe jog until you can do a mile or two per day ( 2 miles = 200 calories X 30 days = 6000 calories = 1.5 lbs lost).  Time spent = 20 minutes.  \n\nNext, do some simple exercises or aerobic routine at a time when you can devote 15 minutes EVERY day.  (if you work up a sweat, you'll burn another 150 calories per day X 30 days = 4500 calories = 1 lb. lost).  Time spent = 15 minutes\n\nFinally, try removing two or three snacks or fattening portions from your daily food intake.  Skip the fries, have one piece of toast instead of two, and eat low fat yogurt or popcorn instead of ice cream (daily calories avoided = 400 X 30 days = 12,000 calories = 3 lbs lost).   Time spent = 0 minutes.\n\nAdd it up.  By devoting 35 minutes per day and a tiny bit of additional will power you're now down 5.5 lbs. in 30 days.  You're feeling healthier and carrying yourself with pride and confidence (That's 90% of a sexy woman right there!).\n\nAnd, if you keep up the routine, you'll be down about 15 - 20 lbs by the end of summer...still warm enough for that bikini!\n\nGood luck.

May 19th is also a Friday, with a rumor of Kane moving to Smackdown! to take Rey Mysterio's World Heavyweight Title.\n\nTo correct a mistake in a previous answer, Glenn Jacobs has been the only one to play the Kane character (aside from the times Taker played him for a 'cahoots' storyline). Rhino in TNA could not have played Kane prior to the demasking, as Rhino is not tall enough to have played Kane.

Also, you'd want time together as a married couple  before rushing off into having babies right? And most of all, you would not want to have the kids when you are like Donald Trump's age becuz that's just silly.,Yeah, probably early 30s.  I wouldn't leave it much longer than that, because there are risks associated with being pregnant when you are older.\n\nTrouble is, I think men can often sense the biological clock ticking, and feel the desperation coming from a woman in that situation, and they get frightened off.  I wouldn't like to be in that position at all.  I would say if having children with someone is high on the list of priorities, do it sooner rather than later.

Over the centuries, your planet was a curious place to visit once or twice and was not considered very interesting . Sure, your wars showed us how undeveloped you are as a species.  Your infantile,(in cosmic terms) dependence on god concepts does not bode well for you and neither does your penchant to breed beyond your planet's ability to sustain you. We are now showing an interest in you because it is not often that we get to observe a species commit suicide. You are so close to maturing as a sentient species and it will be a shame to see you kill yourselves. There are just not enough of you becoming rational enough to force the issue. You let the least among you determine your fate, so be it.

Just how hot is the sun? Besides, why study the sun up close?,The European Space Agency already has a satellite orbiting the sun called the SOHO craft.  It is much more distant than you describe but its images are spectacular.  Many comet chasers use the website to discover new comets orbiting our sun.  Just do a search for SOHO and ESA and you will find the site.

__label__10 , TRIVIA QUESTION...In the movie GLORY, The attack of the 54th Mass. is portrayed wrong in one glaring example?,Anyone care to take a stab at what that was?  I've been out in the sun to long answering questions and killing time while sunning and need to get inside before I burn and this was the only trivia I could come up with...sorry...,Factual errors: \nAt the end of the movie when the 54th is marching onto the beach to prepare to assault Fort Wagner there are about a dozen cannon present with caissons directly behind them. In reality, caissons, containing large amounts of ammunition, would never be that close together or to the actual artillery piece. By rule of thumb caissons were usually kept approximately 50 yards behind the gun, sometimes more, sometimes less. This was done as a precaution so that if a caisson was struck by an enemy shell it wouldn't explode killing and destroying nearby artillerymen, cannons, and other caissons. Never, ever would caissons be less then 10 feet (as they appear in the movie) in distance to an artillery piece(s).\n\nErrors in geography: \nDuring the assault on Fort Wagner, the regiment is charging the wrong way (the Atlantic Ocean should be on their right since they are moving north).\n\nFactual errors: \nIn the scene the night before the big attack on Fort Wagner you are able to see the men's breath. Highly unlikely weather for the summer (July 1863) in South Carolina.\n\nProbably strayed a little of your question, Just did not want to dissapoint with a short answer.

These are then known as “glycoproteins” or “glycolipids”. \n\nGlycoproteins are molecules made of sugars and proteins. They are found coating the surface of every cell in the human body that contains a nucleus. \n\nGlycolipids are molecules made of sugars and fats. “Lipid” and “Fat” are often used interchangeably. \n\nGlyconutrients are the foods and nutritional supplements that provide saccharides along with other glycoforms essential to the body, but which are scarce in most diets.

__label__2 , what is the number of electrons in kryton?,,Krypton has 36 electrons.  It's atomic number is 36 which means it has 36 protons.  Because atoms have the same number of electrons (negative charges) as they do protons (positive charges) then it must also have 36 electrons.\n\nDon't get atoms confused with ions - an ion is an atom that has a positive or negative charge... meaning that it has more or less electrons than it does protons.\n\nAn atom can't have more or less protons without it becoming something else.  If Krypton had one more proton it would be rubidium, if it had one less it would be bromine.\n\nBy the way, kryton (or Kryten) was a character in the TV series Red Dwarf and he would have had squillions of electrons.

__label__5 , disc defragmenter? help?,yesterday when i defragmented the disc it stated i had 34% free space on the local disc C. Today it stated i had 9% free space on the C drive, Ive managed to get it up to 42% free space now but how do i get it to check the CD ROM drive (E)? as when i went into 'my computer' and looked in disc drive E properties it states there was no space available, same with the DVD rom drive. How do i change the local disc (C) so (E) & (D) drives can get defragged aswell,,,,ive deleted most of the programms that i dont use and emptied the trash to see if this will help but to no avail also what is the local disc? is it the floppy? as ive never inserted a floppy disc,,,,,,would it be possisble if you can explain it in non pc gargon if you have any idea to help me,It might help to explain the process of defragmenting.  When your computer is new files are saved whole and your free space is one contiguous area.  As files are saved, deleted, saved again, and so on, the free space on your hard drive becomes divided into little chunks.  When new files are saved into those chunks they must be divided and saved as several smaller pieces and then reassembled when accessed.  Obviously when your computer has to grab several pieces of a file from different places and reassemble it, that is slower.\n\nDefragmenting rearranges the files on your hard drive so that they are saved whole and in one place.  It also makes your free space into a single continous area.\n\nData on a CD or DVD is permanent, that is to say you cannot move or delete it.  Therefore you cannot defragment them.  In fact you don't need to for the same reasons.

Recently, I rededicated my life to the Lord, I love the Lord and I want to make sure that I go to heaven one day, should I get baptised again???? I really need answers, I worry about this quite a it...Thanks!!!,Baptism doesn't save you, only God/Jesus/The Spirit does that.  Baptism is an open declaration of your love and submission to God.  If you want to reaffirm your statement to your church and friends, they will always let you do so, and if you want to be rebaptised, talk to your pastor to see if he is comfortable with doing so.  I can't see why he wouldn't, and if it will help give you peace, I say go ahead, but please know, if you have given your life to God, you are saved, and baptism is only to show others of your promise to God.

__label__4 , Does any one have information on Eleanor Roosevelt?,I'm doing a report for school, and need some mmore information.,Anna Eleanor Roosevelt \n\nA shy, awkward child, starved for recognition and love, Eleanor Roosevelt grew into a woman with great sensitivity to the underprivileged of all creeds, races, and nations. Her constant work to improve their lot made her one of the most loved--and for some years one of the most revered--women of her generation. \n\nShe was born in New York City on October 11, 1884, daughter of lovely Anna Hall and Elliott Roosevelt, younger brother of Theodore. When her mother died in 1892, the children went to live with Grandmother Hall; her adored father died only two years later. Attending a distinguished school in England gave her, at 15, her first chance to develop self-confidence among other girls. \n\n \nTall, slender, graceful of figure but apprehensive at the thought of being a wallflower, she returned for a debut that she dreaded. In her circle of friends was a distant cousin, handsome young Franklin Delano Roosevelt. They became engaged in 1903 and were married in 1905, with her uncle the President giving the bride away. Within eleven years Eleanor bore six children; one son died in infancy. I suppose I was fitting pretty well into the pattern of a fairly conventional, quiet, young society matron, she wrote later in her autobiography. \n\nIn Albany, where Franklin served in the state Senate from 1910 to 1913, Eleanor started her long career as political helpmate. She gained a knowledge of Washington and its ways while he served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. When he was stricken with poliomyelitis in 1921, she tended him devotedly. She became active in the women's division of the State Democratic Committee to keep his interest in politics alive. From his successful campaign for governor in 1928 to the day of his death, she dedicated her life to his purposes. She became eyes and ears for him, a trusted and tireless reporter. \n\nWhen Mrs. Roosevelt came to the White House in 1933, she understood social conditions better than any of her predecessors and she transformed the role of First Lady accordingly. She never shirked official entertaining; she greeted thousands with charming friendliness. She also broke precedent to hold press conferences, travel to all parts of the country, give lectures and radio broadcasts, and express her opinions candidly in a daily syndicated newspaper column, My Day. \n\nThis made her a tempting target for political enemies but her integrity, her graciousness, and her sincerity of purpose endeared her personally to many--from heads of state to servicemen she visited abroad during World War II. As she had written wistfully at 14: ...no matter how plain a woman may be if truth & loyalty are stamped upon her face all will be attracted to her.... \n\nAfter the President's death in 1945 she returned to a cottage at his Hyde Park estate; she told reporters: the story is over. Within a year, however, she began her service as American spokesman in the United Nations. She continued a vigorous career until her strength began to wane in 1962. She died in New York City that November, and was buried at Hyde Park beside her husband.

I just attended a seminar on death and dying and they said that one of the things that we need to do is to take care of ourselves...even though that is something most people that are taking care of others dont do.  You will be much more capable of helping others if you take care of yourself. They said to do something that you enjoy at least once a week...even if it just soaking in a bubble bath for half an hour and reading...just some little thing that you like to do.  If you are caring for a family member you may have to enlist some outside help for that...it may be worth the money to call a local agency on aging to see if they have anyone that will come in and take over for a few hours every week.  They are usually fairly inexpensive and even just a few hours away will help you out. If you are working in a nursing home or hospital maybe request a day off and just sleep late...go shopping...catch a movie...whatever you need to do to have a little break.  Good luck to you!

__label__7 , Do you think God exists?? or are we just assuming there is God somewhere in the universe watching us??!!?,Please give ur opinions with relevant reasons to support urselves.. ur experiences with God are also welcome.. Thanks!!  =),Of course there is some question of, Why are we here? and the Meaning of life? I believe strongly in God. I believe he sent his son down to earth to die for my sins, your sins, and everyone sins. Jesus, bridges the gap between God and us that was separated when Adam and Eve first turn their backs on him in the Garden of Eden. Sacrificing something pure, like a lamb, then was the gap filled. But then Jesus came, a pure being, God’s only son, he was like the lamb, pure and without sin, sacrificed for our sins to fill the gap between God and us. Believing in Jesus and accepting him into our lives fill that gap to God and we have access to eternal life. \n\nGod is so significant in my life. My mother was taken from me at 12 years old by ovarian cancer. I didn’t think God cared. Later I experienced trials of my faith. I grew to learn that there is a purpose to everything and that everything happens for a reason. Everything happens for the best. \n\nOne certain case, I believe, would be that an angel of the Lord confronted me. I had had some troubles at home and I stormed off to my school. I sat there on the swing sets looking down at the ground. I noticed the school was completely empty. I cannot recall any sound of the highway that could be heard very clearly near by. Then I noticed a young woman with blonde hair. She was pushing a baby in a stroller. She had been walking around the track and soon came to the playground, which I had been the whole time. She slowly approached and asked if I was all right. Of course, I said yes, trying to shrug her off. She asked me if I knew about Jesus. I thought that she saw it was a perfect opportunity to preach about Jesus and God. I already knew all that stuff, I told her I knew him and told her my father is involved with the church. She smiled and said that that was nice. She then said something I will never forget. She said with a smile on her face, “Alright, just know that He loves you and knows that you are upset.” I smiled, thinking that she was being nice. She started walking away and she said, “Nice talking to you, Michael.” She walked away towards the surrounding school buildings. I then realized, I never mentioned my name. I didn’t even know her. In a small community, I had never seen her before. I then got on my bike and rode to the building to talk again with her. She had gone past the building very shortly before I arrived there on my bike. I turned the corner and she wasn’t there. It was physically impossible to get out of the school that fast, especially with a baby. I was then filled with a great sense of power and strength. It was a great feeling. I rode my bike home faster than ever. I was crying all the way home.\n\nI have told this story to only a few people. I never expected people to believe me; I could care less if they didn’t. I believe what happened. I was there. That helped incidence helped me so much. I felt much better after that. Today, I still have problems. I am human. But I can always turn to Jesus for help. I believe in him by Faith, and Faith alone. That is all you need to attain salvation! Faith.\n\nI hope you understand to that God loves you. \n             God Bless You!\n                  Michael DeCourcy

Ever before? in real life?,ur relative or any 1....have seen......?then y?,Yes, i see him everyday in the faces of people, the people who suffer and the people who is happy, every of them are a little piece of God. If you understand, God is the power in your heart, is the power who makes you a better human being, if you can focus him on the feelings and the faces of the people around you..., if you can see feelings beyond your own feelings, then you have seen God. People frecuently ask why we had seen statues of God when we really dont know how he looks like, that is the answer, somebody had made this figure of him to make us know that he is one of us or every of us, is not a man or a woman, is not an adult or a child, is all of us and the power we have inside. The power to love and give, or the power to hate and destroy, the power we have to change things, that is God!.

Is there anything which someone out there has tried and which does not require EXTREME effort, money or time ??,No problem buddy. Heres the deal. \n1) Avoid using computer too much from too short distance, but if you have to work try to put a UV protection screen on the front of your monitor/laptop.\n\n2) If using a CRT monitor (the old big ones) throw it away cuz ur eyes are much more valuable than anyting out there. Buy the one with LCD/TFT screen which now have low emission and a 20 inch will just cost $300 which is nothing compared to your eyes.\n\n3) The glasses/spectacles you are wearing change them, and get a new lens with the power you require but go for a new type of lenses rather costyl which are called polariod lens or UV protector aka Double layer coated lens.\n\n4) Eat as much green as possible, including carrots which have a precursor of Vit A, also you can take vitaming supplements with the help of your doctor.\n\n5) Try to take a walk on grass or go to greener areas and walk there for 30 min or so thrice in a week.\n\nI hope this helps you.

Explain your position.,Are we speaking about biology here? Sociology? Politics?\n\nI'll assume biology. On the face of it it would seem true, if environmental conditions changed, the species adapting best to exploit it should out compete the others. Speed in reaching the best adaptation would make sure of it. However if a species were to rapidly adapt to aberrant cyclic changes in the environment, that might not guarantee long term success. And mobility and the ability to relocate as conditions changed might have an advantage over adapting to change until that were no longer possible.\n\nSimple algae species have survived for millions of years as more complex species have come and gone.

__label__2 , Explain how the periodic table can act as a guide to write the electron configurations?,,The properties of an atom depend ultimately on the number of electrons in the various orbitals, and on the nuclear charge which determines the compactness of the orbitals. In order to relate the properties of the elements to their locations in the periodic table, it is often convenient to make use of a simplified view of the atom in which the nucleus is surrounded by one or more concentric spherical shells, each of which consists of the highest-principal quantum number orbitals (always s- and p-orbitals) that contain at least one electron. The shell model (as with any scientific model) is less a description of the world than a simplified way of looking at it that helps us to understand and correlate diverse phenomena. The principal simplification here is that it deals only with the main group elements of the s- and p-blocks, omitting the d- and f-block elements whose properties tend to be less closely tied to their group numbers. \n\nIn particular, the number of outer-shell electrons (which is given by the rightmost digit in the group number) is a major determinant of an element's combining power, or valence. The general trend is for an atom to gain or lose electrons, either directly (leading to formation of ions) or by sharing electrons with other atoms so as to achieve an outer-shell configuration of s2p6. This configuration, known as an octet, corresponds to that of one of the noble-gas elements of Group 18.

Although there is no one best plan, there are some plans that will be better than others for you and your family's health needs. Plans differ, both in how much you have to pay and how easy it is to get the services you need. Although no plan will pay for all the costs associated with your medical care, some plans will cover more than others.\n\nGo here to learn more...good luck

The ruling held that segregation (for example, separate bathroom facilities etc. for Colored and White people) was allowed in the US.\n\nThis was overruled about 60 years later, though, by the Brown v. Board of Education decision. Here, they ruled that segregation in America would NOT be tolerated. For specific case details, search the Internet for Plessy v Ferguson or Brown v Board of Education.
__label__2 , What hormone is active when some one is acting on stage?,I'm not really talking about the nerves, just that feeling of excitement.  Unless its the same thing.,There are two.

__label__10 , few countries with freedom of speech, why they restrict deny of Holocaust and not printing of racist cartoons?,What does freedom of speech means? and what should the country do and the citizens do in terms of freedom of speech on the issues of Denying of Holocaust and printing racist cartoons.,The thing people forget or are confusing in this whole issue is that that the people that are rioting over the Danish cartoons think that the governernment of Denmark has something to do with the printing/content of that paper. Here, is the US, decisions on what to print are made by editors based on what they personally deem 'newsworthy' or what will sell papers, providing it isn't libelous or slanderous. Freedom of speech means you cansay anything you want and I will defend your right to say it. I DO NOT have to agree with what you are saying to want you to be able to express it. I personally, thought the cartoons were in poor taste, as I would any cartoons of someone else's religion. But it isn't illegal in the US to print bad taste. See most all of our newspapers for reference...\n\nWhere there is no free speech/free press, what is in the papers is an extension of the government. Here, the press is frequently counter to the goverment. They help to keep them in check.\n\nHolocaust/racist cartoons don't get printed in the mainstream press not because they against the law, but because they will upset people and cause the paper not to be bought. The Islamic cartoons weren't printed here, either, for the same reasons.

__label__1 , If you can't create something from nothing... where did god come from?,If you think that it is impossible that something so complex as life could originate from random events... how did god come about?\n\nIf god existed forever, then why couldn't the universe always exist?\n\nWhat's a simpler idea:  a universe forever... or a creator forever creating a universe.  Occam's Razor:  The simpler theory gets chosen.,Scientific evidence has demonstrated that the universe IS constntly expanding. There is also evidence to suggest that at one point the universe was nothing but a single atom-speck,, and that something (The Big Bang) made it expand outward, creating the outer rim of the universe.\n\nSo we can reasonably assume that at one point the universe was essentially non-existent, and that something made it into what it is now.\n\nAs for the creation of God, the Bible doesn't cover it. Since that's the only source of Christian information we can accept as true, we *don't know* how God was created. But to answer your question: I believe it's easier for one being to have existed forever instead of our universe having existed forever. Scientific evidence supports the former and rejects the latter.

__label__8 , Which state has the biggest rednecks? Biggest hillbillies?,There are rednecks everywhere, I know.  People give AL, MS, LA, TX, GA, FL, TN, SC, NC, and WV a bad rap.  They give Arkansas a horrible rep!  But, I'm not so sure any of those are as bad as Kentucky (especially east of Shelbyville and Bardstown) and southern Illinois.  People still walk around barefooted in Wal-Mart and in the park on any given day in Kentucky.,Biggest Rednecks - Mississippi\nBiggest Hillbillies - Kentucky\n\nBut they are everywhere.

__label__4 , What factors may influence their claims?,My professor wants me to evaluate the credibility of the following sources: newspapers, magazines, television programs, movies, news reporting, the internet, and advertising. What factors may influence their claims?,I've never been to college, didn't even finish high school, but I can tell you it is Personal Bias, Political Bias, Commercial (or money inspired) Bias.   \n\nThe media outlets all must have a positive profit model in order to stay in operation, this means there is quite a bit of external influence as to what is reported and what is left out, and this influence even extends to how the information which they do report is worded. \n\nIgnorance is a factor that plagues the internet and some news outlets.  It's difficult to know what factors could be influencing an anonymous person to make claims.  Their health, their experiences,  their likes and dislikes, what they intend to achieve with the claim, all have influence.\n\nProduct manufacturers, or any publicly traded company can be held financially liable if they don't do everything within the law to garner the greatest margins of profit for their business.  This encourages advertisement to be rife with misleading images, words and even subliminally suggested intentions.   Money is a huge factor that influences all advertisement claims. \n\nI have to note that each of the fields you mentioned have their own specific influencing factors, and it's difficult to generalize them across the whole lot.  For instance, a movie's claims are often motivated by the writer or directors specific intentions of how they wish to influence people with the work.  You aren't likely to see this as much in say.. news reporting.

Can anyone show me evidence these treatments are effective cures?,Here are a few major references in the medical literature.

__label__7 , Online banking question?,My bank is Chase. My stepmom has access to my online banking; it is part of her account. If I deposit a check into the account, using online banking can she see who wrote the check? I was just wondering how it would show up. Thank you,It depends. Some banks, instead of sending back your checks with every statement, send only copies of the checks, and this may include all checks deposited to the account.  If you go online and look at the statement, you can click on any line item on the statement and it will bring up an image of that item, front and back.  If Chase does that then yes, by going into the online statement and clicking on any item she will be able to see an image of that item.\n\nIf the deposit item in question is a check drawn on a local bank, you may be able to go to that bank and cash it, then take the cash and make a cash deposit into your joint checking account.  This way all your mom can see is a cash deposit.  if you don't even want her to see the cash, and need to pay some bills, take the cash and go to the post office and buy money orders for the amounts of the bills you need to pay, and send the money orders as payments.  This way, your mom will not see any deposit at all, or at most a very much reduced one.\n\nI used to do all this to keep it looking like I had no income and no deposits to my checking account.  Once I went to the post office and bought a total of $5,000 in a whole bunch of money orders, and only $300 or so actually made it as cash into my checking account.  For all intents and purposes if you looked at my checking account it looked like I was dead broke and in abject poverty.

__label__10 , Withdrawing our troops from Iraq? Do you agree the quick extraction will be okay?,New democrat congress suggested the new time table for getting out of Iraq. I was told, it is pretty much evacuating the allied troops very soon.\n\nBut according to today's news, Top U.S. army general in  the mid east, John Abizaid, disagrees with it.\n\nHe instead emphathized on strengthening Iraqi government on standing up its own feet.\n\nAbizaid's argument was that if we leave right now, there will be worse violence and chaos.\n\n\nSo, it looks like we can not get out Iraq anytime soon. And this will suck up our nation's energy, money, human resources, and in my opinion, this prolonged Iraq occupation will cause the U.S. to lag behind its internal development (ex: catching up the technology, funding the school systems, building more hospitals, helping out the disadventaged, etc.) to the other rising countries like China, etc.\n\nWhat is your idea on how long will the U.S. stay in Iraq, and what needs to be done to ready for the U.S. leave? \n\nI want to hear your strategy.,We should withdraw them as soon as possible. I know that many people want a phased withdrawal lasting something like 18-24 months. Abizaid also warns against a quick pullout. Here is the bottom line: if we left a year ago there would be a civil war, if we leave tomorrow there will be a civil war, if we leave in a year there will be a civil war. When we leave there will be massive bloodshed, no way to avoid it. There is really no point now in risking more American lives when the outcome is certain.

__label__3 , What's the best way to go about gaining more self-esteem?,one of my new year's resolutions.,Get a sheet of paper and list things that you would like to do and acomplish them (start out simple). Take some time to do something nice for someone. It feels good. List your good qualities- I'm sure you have many. Most people tend to look at what they don't like about themselves and ignore the wonderful qualities that make them THEM! I think the older a person gets the easier it is. If your in certain age groups no one has good self esteem, even those who seem to have it. Some people who are popular and seek attention and friends have the worst self asteem and waste so much energy trying to prove themselves. If there are some qualities that you don't like, change them. If your self esteem is based on looks alone (don't know what you look like) accentuate the positive about yourself!

__label__1 , Have you ever seen an angel, a vision of one through a dream, or stories about them personally?,An older relative told me when she was a little girl, her father broke his leg and could not go up the ladder to turn on the lighthouse light for the ships. She was 10 yrs old, scared, prayed for guidance to go up the long stairs black in the darkness of night. She prayed, looked up, and say an angel at the top, wings spread, light glowing down the stairs, so she could go up. She said she never forgot it. That was 50 yrs ago, and I never forgot it either, the day she shared her night in the darkness, when God sent an angel to let her see her way. That is my story, do you have one too?,Hi,look some people are very narrow minded and like to limit God to their own little perceptions, of course there are Angels(messengers of God), and if God sends an Angel to assist one of His children on earth that Angel has the power to make himself visible if needs be.\nis it not strange that so many people believe in the realism of things like the Loch Ness monster or little green men etc and yet that reality pertaining to God and His creative order is spurned.\nand to answer your question I have seen an Angel, just once in my own life and I do mean that I saw not imagined, I was in terrible spiritual danger and was comforted and reassured by this Heavenly Messenger, and I thank God for sending him.\nthe Angels of God fight against the dominion of the evil one and his wicked hoards and come to our aid in this spiritual battle,don`t try to prove it as much as believe it.

This tilts the chances slightly in our favour, but do not underestimate Croatia, who have a tough team and are proven at the World Cup (semi finalists in 1998 and have qualified every time they have attempted - 1998, 2002 and 2006)\n\nAustralia will likely face Italy, Ghana or Czech Republic in the 2nd round (assuming they finish 2nd in their group, USA cannot top their group). \n\nIf they play Czech Republic, they will almost definately lose (although Guus is a genius and a hate to write him off).\n\nIf they face Italy, they will be massive underdogs. While Italy don't look impressive, we know that they are famous for under performing.\n\nIf they face Ghana, I believe we are favourites. That is not to underestimate Ghana, who have a very good midfield and are extremely athletic. But we have some top defenders and are coached by the KING.

I really need to deal with this problem, so i have a normal life!,If you indeed have PTSD you need to get professional counseling. Its not going to go away with medication. Your doctor is prescribing wellbutrin to deal with the depression that the PTSD is causing you. Theres no medication for PTSD, you have to go through therapy, and I strongly suggest that you do, for your own sake and your children. Your problem will only get worse without proper help. If something traumatic happened to you, you need to get professional help to help you deal with it. good luck.
__label__9 , Do Christians recognize as legitimate marriages performed by non-Christian clergy?,Sure, it's before G*d, but WHICH ONE?,They do. Back in the day, they would not have, since the Church was the only place you were allowed to get married, but alas, those days have passed.\nAnyway, nowadays, no matter WHO marries you, as long as they are recognized by the STATE in which you get married, it's considered a legitimate marriage.\nAlthough I think you're asking more along the lines of would they recognize and accept it? Some would, since the person who performed the marriage has to be legally licensed to do so. Some would NOT because they were not married in the eyes of God. They, in my opinion, are wrong. When two people love each other, yes, they can make that love whole by getting married, but if it's not in the Christian church, it shouldn't be a big deal.

The ony good thing about bugs/food poisoning, in my experience, is that they don't last very long. Get someone to go out and get something like Immodium for you; that should stop the diarrhoea. Make sure you drink plenty of water as you don't want to get dehydrated.
__label__2 , what the updates on the columbia river regrading to salmon and the hydroelectricity?,the Salmon,Which Columbia river? The fact is using hydroelectricity is a wonderful resource, until you think about the fish. Salmon are migratory species which means they pass through rivers on their way to coastal feeding grounds and back to spawn. \nThis means that great big hydroelectric dams on the river stop the salmon from moving around and become trapped.\n\nBasically the fish stocks of salmon are going to be depleted from over fishing and dams soon anyway, so enjoy your fish while you got it. Its the tragedy of the commons.

I posted a link below to see what a matrix plot looks like.\n\nOf course you really can't see a normal distribution on a scatter plot.  If you add up the students exams or take the mean, you can draw a histogram of the data to get an idea what the distribution looks like.  It's possible that they are normally distributed, but it depends on the exams and the skill level of the class.  If one exam is easy, then its distribution would be skewed to the left (meaning it has a left tail), which would not be normal-looking.  Same thing with hard exams except those would be skewed to the right.  Then also, since classes are not selected randomly and the tests are different, you cannot be assured that the Central Limit Theorem will hold for the means, especially since you are only taking the means of 5 tests, but it is possible that you will.

She keeps telling me that she is coming back home. But something always comes up is she really coming home...,Unless any of us are a legitimate fortune teller we can only speculate. But being a woman, myself, and from a woman's point of view, if your wife has told you she is going to come home, then try and relax. Have faith in what she is saying. Maybe this is a flaw in your marriage that needs to get worked out. You are going to run your self mentally crazy, if you can't believe your mate. Quit wasting precious energy being suspicious. Channel this energy into thinking what you are going to do differently when she comes home to work out the original problem. Tell yourself, you have nothing to fear, but your own suspicions. I promise you, that most break ups are caused by one or the other, accusing them of doing something. They figure if they are going to be accused,  they might as well do it. Not good logic, but we are talking about love, and there is no logic in this emotion. Keep faith!!!

It just depends on how long you guys have been dating. you shouldn't jump to conclusions if your not sure.
__label__7 , what can i do if i've been wrongfully conficted as a sex offender, due to a fabricated story.?,This underage girl from laguna beach, made up a story to the police about someone pantsing her (pulling her underwear up and giving her a wedgie) or something. The police approached me about touching women. I responded sarcastically, and three days later they arrested me. I decided to fight the case rather than deal with a false charge on my record. I lost the case and have to register now, as a sex offender. I'm still fighting this case. My public defender, didn't object to some of the unnecessary questions from court. The transcript is evidence that this case isn't actually credible at all. Anyone can follow the transcript word for word and tell the charges were all made up and someone wanted to make sure i got convicted of this very real charge. I don't know when i'll be off the hook, but, the attorney whose working on it now, isn't doing much about it. I spent eight months in jail because i didn't go home when i was asked about this incident the first time. What can i do?,Call around to Appellate Lawyers to see who will look at the case to see if you have grounds for appeal....contact the local Bar association for a list of attornies who deal in post conviction or appellate matters. The local chapter of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers might also be able to provide some names... With what you've told us, it certainly sounds like the DA inflated the charges...even if what the girl said is true and someone gave her a wedgie, at most that is simple assault not a sexual crime, so there is a chance that a good lawyer can get that conviction overturned or the charge reduced on appeal...Good luck.
__label__5 , Is it possible to connect simultaneously through two modems installed on the pc?,,Yes. A company called Diamond MultiMedia made a modem years ago called the Shotgun.

__label__6 , What is the difference between the Champions league and the UEFA?,What is the difference and WHO and HOW do teams qualify for both of them, thanks.,Champions League (More prestigious)\nAli sort of had it, but it is more complicated than the top four teams from each country league qualify.  The different countries have rankings based on how good the league is.  The top 3 leagues each get four teams, the leagues ranked 4-6 have three teams, the leagues ranked 7-15 get two teams, and leagues ranked 16 and lower get one team.  So the Spanish league, ranked number one, gets four teams qualified, while the Dutch league, ranked number seven, gets two teams qualified.  But then it gets even more complicated because they don't all enter the tournament at the same time.  The champions from the top 9 ranked leagues all automatically get to the group stage (32 teams in total), along with second place teams from the top 6 ranked leagues and the Champions League returning winner.  The other 16 teams come from previous round qualifying stages.  The link provided has a good breakdown of all the stages.\n\nUEFA Cup is basically the best teams that don't make it to the Champions League.  In fact, some teams that get eliminated from the Champions League in the group stage get thrown back into the EUFA cup competition.  \n\nCheck out the link.  \nThe second link shows the ranking of the leagues (scroll down to where it says League Coefficients)

__label__2 , Why do we immediately start dreaming when we pass out?,I've passed out twice in my life and each time I started dreaming. Of course, I didn't realize I'd passed out until I came to but it was much more disorienting because I'd been dreaming and didn't know what was going on at first. I talked to a friend about it and he said that he started dreaming when he passed out once at the doctor's. So why is that?,REM sleep is initatiated by the 'pons' of your brain.  It releases a chemical acetylcholine, which then causes the other body reactions to begin.

Slavery was not abolished, no 15th amendment,I found a mention of this in the NORTH STAR and am kinda surprised that I have not heard of this voting population before.,It's because they were all free Americans in New York.

__label__1 , Why do Christians still follow the Ten Commandments?,If the Old Testament no longer applies to Christians, because Jesus was fulfillment of the prophecies of the OT, and the laws of Moses no longer apply, then why do Christians still follow the Ten Commandments?  Didn't Jesus make them obsolete?,Many (MATT.7:14)christians try to cite verses(1TIM.1:7)(MARK 7:7) to say the 10 commandments are done away with; when they don't know what the passage is saying. They want to attack Jesus; so they're against Christ; so I wouldn't call them christians. But back to your question--\nSome (MATT.7:14)christians still keep the law because the Bible tells us to. These same christians follow Jesus (Col.2:6).\nHere are the verses for the 10 Commandments in New Testament:\n     ROM.3:31; GAL.3:21; JOHN 14:15; 15:10; 1JOHN 3:4,24; 5:2-3; REV.12:17; 14:7,12

(there's this girl i've been flirting with and i'm not sure if she has a bf or not ... could she just be 'havin fun with me'???,depends..girls like attention and flirting. If she does not like you, she would probably tell you that she was involved with someone right away just to get away. If she responds to your cues, then there is no doubt that she is interested. Be careful though, too much too soon can destroy everything. So take baby steps and do not act desperate..disappear for a day or two..she will come running simply because she could not handle a sudden shift in attention.

__label__6 , Joey Giardello vs Thomas Hearns.  Who wins?,15 rounds at middleweight,Tough Guy ~\n                     In my opinion, Joey gets Knocked out cold in less than 5 rounds. Joey was a real tough cookie back in the day, but he lacked the power to hurt and stop Herans. Herans being the much taller of the two would throw his right hand at will and catch Giardello every time he threw it. Joey was notorious for getting hit a lot.\n                    A little inside bit for you, Augie Semeca who use to be Charles Brewer's trainer and one time South Philadelphia Gym owner and I were talking a couple months back at Joe Hands Gym in South Philly about tough fighters from Philly and I brought up Giardello and about two minutes later Joey came walking through the door. He sat down and started talking to Augie and Augie introduced me to him, anyways to make a long story short and without pulling any punches Joey said I never trained, I'd be out with the boys all of the time, I didn't have time to train, there was too much going on. I was always a tough kid and could handle my own, but I never fully dedicated myself to the sport.\n     Tommy's workouts with Steward at the Kronk Gym are legendary. I worked out at the gym before and it's always HOT in there no matter what time of the year you're there. Tommy worked the pads with Manny and it would resemble a actual fight. Tommy would hit the bag for a hour straight with only a minute rest between rounds. Milton McCory would often be heard saying That man aint right, alls he wants to do is train like a crazy man\n     This would be the biggest difference in this fight Tommy would be able to go non-stop until he stops Giardello, don't get me wrong here, Joey wouldn't be a push over he'd crack Tommy with some good shots too, but it wouldn't be enough to keep Tommy off of him.

If we are talking about CD-Audio Standards then it can store upto 80 minutes of sound recording, this will be stored on tracks, you can not store these tracks to your computer hard disk. If you want to store your audio cd on your computer then you have to convert it (RIP) into mp3 or wma format using Media Player 10 or any other Ripper, it will convert the CD-Audio track into almost 4mb file. but remember its another standard.\nThe best way to check whether your car sound system play mp3 or not is that try to play an mp3 CD in it. :)

Rightly or wrongly.  The astonishing thing about it is that the rest of the world consider it to be a sport.  This amazes the Spanish people. Bull fighting has never been considered a sport in Spain.  It is a form of theatre.  It is a display of man against beast and is one of the largest audience spectacles in the world.  It is classed as tragic theatre in much the same way as Macbeth by Shakespeare.  \n\nThe bulls that are used in the bullfights are specifically bred for that purpose and until their day of reckoning they are kept in the lap of luxury and are fed the best of food.....the training grounds are immaculate and the spend their days being pampered and very well looked after.  Of course they have their final day in the bullring and we all know the results of that.  It is however part of the theatre and part of the culture of Spain.\n\nBy the way, I am not a supporter of bull-fighting but I do know a lot about the history of it.....it is not as simple as killing for killing's sake.  The bull will always die, that is the tragedy of the theatre of the bullfight, but the unknown element and the excitement comes from the knowledge that the matador could also die in his efforts to kill the bull...that is what the crowd go for.....the challenge of man against beast...it is part of the old spanish culture.

__label__2 , What is the most likely scenario in which the world & life, as we know it, will come to an end? And when?,,None of the ideas suggested in the answers so far would result in an end of ALL life on earth. As humans we think of ourselves as important, but in the greater scheme of things we are not. A biog comet impact might wipe out humans, but it would not wipe out life, in fact for many of the surviving species it would be a very poitive outcome, getting rid of homo sapiens, the planets biggest poluters and parasites. The end of lie on Earht is likely to happen when the sun reaches the end of it current stage of hydrogen fusion, this will happen in about 5 billion yeras, so we are hal way there. the sun will at first contract, then as it gets hot enough for Helium to fuse it will expand and become a REd Giant. THIS will end life on earth, effectively. The earth may even be swallowed up as the sun swells to a diameter of around 300,000,000 km which is about the same as the earths orbit (so the earth would be at the surface of the sun).
__label__10 , What is the Law of Domain?,,Eminent domain (US), compulsory purchase (United Kingdom, New Zealand), compulsory acquisition (Australia) or expropriation (Canada, South Africa) in common law legal systems is the lawful power of the state to expropriate private property without the owner's consent, either for its own use or on behalf of a third party. The term eminent domain is used primarily in the United States, where the term was derived in the mid-19th century from a legal treatise written by the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius in 1625. The term compulsory purchase, also originating in the mid-19th Century, is used primarily in England and Wales, and other jurisdictions that follow the principles of English law. Originally, the power of eminent domain was assumed to arise from natural law as an inherent power of the sovereign.\n\nGovernments most commonly use the power of eminent domain when the acquisition of real property is necessary for the completion of a public project such as a road, and the owner of the required property is unwilling to negotiate a price for its sale. In many jurisdictions the power of eminent domain is tempered with a right that just compensation be made for the appropriation.\n\nSome coined the term expropriation to refer to appropriation under eminent domain law, and may especially be used with regard to cases where no compensation is made for the confiscated property. Examples include the 1960 Cuban expropriation of property held by U.S. citizens, following a breakdown in economic and diplomatic relations between the Eisenhower Administration and the Cuban government under Fidel Castro. U.S. nationals and corporations held vast amounts of Cuba's prime real-estate. Cuban authorities offered just compensation for US properties, as they had successfully done for Spanish, British and French properties when they nationalized private property in Cuba, for the common good. However, U.S. authorities refused, adhering to the notion that those properties are still privately owned by U.S. interests forty five years later. This is in direct contrast with recent rulings by the US Supreme Court which allows a corporation to displace a private citizen from his/her realty, if the corporate development is considered to be in the best interest of the municipality.\n\nThe term condemnation is used to describe the act of a government exercising its authority of eminent domain. It is not to be confused with the term of the same name that describes the legal process whereby real property, generally a building, is deemed legally unfit for habitation due to its physical defects. Condemnation via eminent domain indicates the government is taking the property; usually, the only thing that remains to be decided is the amount of just compensation. Condemnation of buildings on grounds of health and safety hazards or gross zoning violation usually does not deprive the owner of the property condemned but requires the owner to rectify the offending situation.\n\nThe exercise of eminent domain is not limited merely to real property. Governments may also condemn the value in a contract such as a franchise agreement (which is why many franchise agreements will stipulate that in condemnation proceedings, the franchise itself has no value).

__label__7 , Should we retire?,After 6 long years, we have accrued about $500K in a pharmaceutical investment that has a 95% chance of passing FDA.  It has received Priority Review status and will be the only drug in a very large market.  Tomorrow it moves from the AMEX to the NASDAQ.  Should we keep our investment and take the slight risk with the chance for huge reward, or should we take the money off the table and have a modest retirement?  We have about $400K in equity in our current house and owe about $200K on our retirement property.  We also have about $225K in other investments.\n\nWe are 40 and 42 and both have good jobs and no kids.  Neither of us wants to work any more.  Well, not for the time being anyway.\n\nWe both have the wander lust and basically need the stock to double to have everything we'll ever want for the rest of our lives.  If it passes, it will do at least that.  But, we could walk away today and live modestly.\n\nWhat would you do?,If I were in youre shoes I'd take a slight risk for the huge reward.If it falls through youre still set up pretty good with equities and other investments,Plus youre still very young and if need be could work a few more years .It doesnt appear to me if it doesnt get approved youre out on welfare.Successful people seem to be risk takers .I'm not saying you should do it I'm saying if it were me I would !

__label__2 , Why we cannt craete a new folder with namecon on desktop?,,This is a leftover from the old, old days of computers, as in the 1980's.  Back then, a computer just had a fixed number of 'ports' that you could plug printers, modems, mice, etc. into.  USB and firewire are much much better, so most new computers don't have them, but you might see trapezoid shaped connectors with 9 or 25 little metal pins on some PCs.\n\nEach port on the computer had a name, like COM1:, PRT:, and so on.  These names referred to the hardware connections, so they couldn't be used to name a file.  For instance, one way of printing things then was just to copy a file to the printer:\n      copy file  PRT:\nCON was one of these devices...it represented the screen and keyboard.  So, you could display a file on the screen by copying it to CON:, and record keyboard input by copying CON: to a file.  \n\nIf you're comfortable in a command prompt, this still works.  Try doing\n   copy some_file CON:\nand you'll see the file contents on the screen. Try\n   copy CON: filename\nand you'll be able to type directly into a file.  Be careful, this will erase the file if it already exists. (Hit Ctrl-Z when your done).\n\nMicrosoft has a real devotion to backwards compatibility--that is, they try to make sure things that worked with old versions of Windows still work with new versions.  This is kind of taking it to extremes, since any program that uses this would be 20+ years old now.

Is there an easy way to this???,The solution is in the units. Before you starting to solve, you should check the units and understand that correctly.\n\nLet's solve the question. \n\n100m/s to km/h;\nif we travel 100m in 1 second then we travel (3600*100)m in a hour. \n!!!Because 1 hour is equal to 3600 seconds.!!!(Eq.1)\n\n360000m is equal 360km. \n\n!!!Because 1000m is equal 1km.!!!(Eq.2)\nSo your first question's answer is 360km/h\n\nNow, using the information above we convert 60km/h to m/s.\nWell, 60 km is equal 60000m. (Eq.2)\n60000/3600= 16,67m/s (Eq.1)\n\nLet me ask a question. What is the 717 miles/h in m/s?

You will probably find that the fingers of your left hand will develop blisters from pressing on the frets, but with time these should disappear. \n\nAlthough you might want to learn fast it is better to try to build up your technique slowly and make sure that you are comfortable with one lesson before you move on to the next one. Lots of people learn to strum a few chords on the guitar, but it takes time and effort to learn to play it really well.

We have one year trying but still is not working for him.,You've got some good suggestions so far (and some pretty crappy answers too).  \n\n1.  Make sure that there is a long round of foreplay.  The more excited and relaxed he is, the easier it will be.  \n\n2.  Use plenty of lube. Infact, I would say, that you cannot use too much lube.\n\n3.  Try (gently) opening up the area with something smaller than what you're currently using:  for example if you're trying to use your penis right now, start with a finger first.  It's smaller and will go in easier.  After awhile of that, he should be reader for bigger objects.\n\n4.  Make sure that you're relaxed also.  If he can sense that you're getting frustrated or impatient, that will carry over to him and make the experience difficult for you both, physically and emotionally.\n\n5.  Check into literature and instructional references about this. The only one I've ever heard of is Bend Over Boyfriend, but I'm sure there are many others.  Look into this together, it will be a unifying activity and give him confidence and reassurance, which will translate into being more relaxed during sex. \n\n6. Make sure to make these experiences enjoyable, even if you don't reach your goal right away make sure that the experience is not a waste.\n\nHope this helps.  Have fun!\n\nFR

Also, she amended the contract twice after we signed it. Is there any way we can get the stove back, legally?? The buyer is a friend of the realtor, so the realtor is on her side.\n\nPS The realtor is representing both the buyer and the seller!,If you signed the contract, you can't get the stove back unless you show malfeasance on the part of the realtor.  It's attached and can't be removed unless the contract says so.\n\nCall the State Ombudsman and ask where you file a complaint.
__label__2 , a geography question?,how was the border between the us and canada established,The first part of the US-Canada border was first defined in 1783 with  the Treaty of Paris, that marked the border between the new United States of America from British colonies in North America. Because the area was not well mapped, there were some disputes, and minor skirmishes, until the Webster–Ashburton Treaty in 1842 which fixed the border between Maine and New Bruinswick. As both the US and British-run Canada were exanding westward in the 1840's, there was another dispute on where the US-Canada border would exist in the western part of the continent. The Americans wanted to claim everything south of the parallel of latitude of 54' degrees 40 minutes. (leading to the phrase 54-40 or fight!). In 1846, the Oregon Territory treaty was passed, setting the US-Canada border as a continuation of the 49th parallel (where it was set along the Minnesota border). In 1903, the boundaries of Alaska were set by a US-British-Canadian commission.\n\nThere are still some areas under dispute between the US and Canada - along the Maine/New Brunswick border, and the Yukon/Alaska border (see second link)

__label__2 , why anything becomes dark in colour when it absorb water and the things which don't seems to be remainunchange,i can explain it as ,the sand on the bank of riverloooks green but if some water is pored on it ,it looks blakish OR the same thing happens with our wet clothes as become dark in comparision with usual colour..the same things not happen wiht the materials that don't absorb water.,Things that look darker when soaked absorb water. The surface tension of water brings the small particles (fibre of a cloth or sand-dust) close 2 each other. As a result the density of the wet thing increases. This causes the object 2 reflect light of a different (greater?) wavelength & the colour darkens.

I think beliving in religion of any sort is a good thing no matter what it is as long as your not too selfish and have an open mind to at least say Hey Im a good person and so are you, why waste time on earth saying how much we hate each other because we belive differently.\nI also think everyone beliving in different religions is a good thing.

For example;  Gilman's 'The Yellow Wallpaper' illustrates her belief that one should take responsibility for their own decisions rather than allowing others to control them.  It appears that her view of life is that to allow others such a level of control prevents the individual from fulfilling the potential of their life.\nI think that you should include some quotes to illustrate why you believe this to be the case.

Ganguly scored a duck and 2 against Worcestershire which was highlighted in the rediff.com cricket page and in the main page of cricinfo.com. It is worth noting that most of his teammates failed too. However, when Ganguly got a quick fire 71 against Nottinghamshire, it was not mentioned in any of these sites as a news item. I got this from a cricinfo.com scorecard as they have to maintain this information. \nWell, answer me if they missed it or chose to miss it ?\nCan we put an end to this ? Its ok that the aussie coach does not want him and his own friend Dravid back stabbed him because he wanted the captaincy but i cant imagine why the journalists who are supposed to be neutral performing this act of hypocracy. This question is not meant for wankers who hate Ganguly.,I totaly agree with you friend.everybody in this world is after ganguly.what we can do is to send them (the sites) a letter with signs from big celebrities.

__label__4 , why the  teachers are teaching the materials?,are they educators?,Teachers teach the material they do because the government tells them to.  They are given objectives that are to be met and have to decide the best way to present the material.  Majority of teachers do try to incorporate different activities or teaching strategies in order to meet the needs of all students.  Smaller assignments, quizzes and in class activities are used to help assess the students understanding and in some subjects a unit test will be given.  THe purpose of a unit test is to evaluate how the student is able to tie EVERYTHING together.  \n\nSome people believe teachers are testing too much but sometimes a test is the only way to truly evaluate what the STUDENT knows.  How many parents help their children with the homework?  Some parents complete the homework for the children because they want their child to get a better grade.  Children learn through doing and by making mistakes. The problem with sending home homework is how does the teacher know how much of the work was completed by the actual student.  If the student is only producing a level 2 in class but on homework assignments hands in level 4 work...why does the difference exist?\n\nEducators need to have the support of the family.  A lot of educators do not agree with the current curriculum but have no choice but to follow the guidelines set out.
__label__10 , What is Global warming? Does anyone have any proof?,I don't believe in global warming, until I have proof. I do believe in politics.,Global warming is the observed increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans in recent decades. (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/global%20warming ). It is mostly man-made and comes from everything from factories to cars. (http://www.epa.gov/ebtpages/airairpoglobalwarming.html )Almost every single real scientific study links global warming directly to humans.\n\nIt's only certain political figures that don't want to change for reasons easily guessable. That is why the whole developed world signed that Kyoto Treaty and why every single developed country is working to reduce their polluting of the air, water, and land. \n\nSee the new Gore movie, it has the backing of the scientific AND POLITICAL groups: \n\nScientific community: http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/200...\n\nGovernment Groups:\n\nNOAA (National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration) on why Peer-Reviewed Journals are the only real scientific studies to be believed: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/globalwar...\n\nThe EPA's site for KIDS: http://www.epa.gov/globalwarming/kids/in...\n\nFrom NASA:\nhttp://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/library...\n\nThe Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is an important part of the U.S. Department of Energy's strategy to understand global climate change:\nhttp://education.arm.gov/studyhall/warmi...\n\nhttp://globalchange.gov/\nhttp://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/climate.s...\nhttp://marine.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/locator?s...\nhttp://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environmen...\nhttp://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalwarming.html\n\nAll of the above are .gov sites.\n\nEdit: \n\nNotice how the person below me offers no evidence what-so-ever.  That is exactly what is holding us back in taking real steps in fixing this very easily fixable problem.  All people like this due is try to poke holes in something that is already rock-solid in ALL REAL SCIENTIFIC (GOVERNMENT) COMMUNITIES. Hollywood, Gore, or anyone else who has made this up.  It is our own government organizations, working separately, that have all come to the same conclusion.  The people who don't believe offer nothing but opinions and fake studies done by non-governmental - or none-peer reviews - organizations.\n\nIt is a real problem that can be fixed with easy measures.
__label__10 , Is it true that bush past a law about students not being able to upgrade student loans?,,He cut $12 billion from the student loan program.  \n\nThe new budget will make it impossible to consolidate student loans.

__label__4 , Do I need to go to medical school to become a Registered Nurse in bachelors?,thanks,I think you may be mixing things up a bit.\n\nYou can become a Registered Nurse without getting a Bachelors of Science but it is getting harder to find nursing programs that do that.\n\nYou should TRY and get a Bachelor of Science Registered Nursing degree if you can.  I am not a nurse, but I work with a lot of them in a hospital and I see the job postings.  Most job postings are looking for BS RN.  More opportunity for you if you go that route, more advancement, management etc.  BIGGER PAYCHECKS.\n\nBut do not let that stop you, if you can become a Registered Nurse without it then go for it.  You can always get the BS degree later on.\n\nGood luck.

My Space is addictive once you learn how to use HTML. There is no turning back, but it serves a general purpose young kids are learning how to build web pages and code web logs. So both are productive in there own way but are they both trully addictive. My best answer would have to be yes. Once an individual figures them out and how to work it.

I want to create an image that is I suppose 16 x 22 in size, but I need to do it on two different sheets of paper. I am putting this image on a cake and the edible ink printer can only print 8 x 11 sheets. i thought if I put two together, I can make the image bigger - but I'm not sure how to split the image up so that it will print out on two different sheets of 8 x 11 paper. Any ideas?,Use Adobe Photo Shop, Print Shop Plus, or Paint. Paint is located under Programs&#92;Accessories, or any other software you might have. Create 2 file folders in the program you chose. Copy the 'full' image into each folder. Open the first folder, determine your 'exact' center-line and erase 1/2 half of the image. Click file and save. Open the other folder, erase the 'other' half of the image and save. Open the first folder, and do your print command. This will print the first half of the image. Open the other folder and again do the print command. This will give you prints of the total image on 2 sheets.

__label__5 , Is there a Firefox extension that will notify you to when a website has updated?,It's easy for websites with an RSS feed, but what about for others?,I do not know of any that would notify you when a website changes. I think the reason for that is with so many websites that have dynamic data, it would become monotonous when you are notified everytime a date changes, or some subtle part of a website changes. \n\nWebsites owners and website visitors are more apt to utilize syndication feeds on thier sites, you might have heard of RSS, or ATOM links. These are ways for a website to publish when new pertinent information is published. Firefox has built in support for RSS/ATOM feeds with the Live Bookmark feature. THere are some options for Internet Explorer as well.\n\nHope this helps.

__label__7 , Does a corporation or DBA still need to trademark their name?,I know they have to trademark their logos but what about just the name?,The choice to trademark is not related to a company name or DBA (Doing Business As). Trademarking is done to protect your interests and rights in a name or phrase.  If your primary brand in the market is your company name (or DBA), trademarking is a good idea.  If your main brand in the market is a product, I recommend trademarking that.\n\nYou can go on the US PTO web site and submit trademarks yourself.  There is alot of information on the USPTO website on the rules and guidelines.  It takes about 1 year or so for an application for go through (or be denied).  Once you have applied for trademark (or service mark), make sure you label all of your sales, marketing and corporate materials with SM or TM.\n\nRelated to your question might also be whether you own the Internet URL for the company or DBA.

__label__10 , Does anyone worry that Middle eastern terrorists are dressing up as Mexicans and hopping the border?,This is a serious question, that just kind of hit me.  It makes sense in a sick sorta way.  Maybe we better get a handle on this Border hopping quickly.,I live just over 100 miles from the border and I have been thinking about that for a few years now. Ever since the NAFTA agreement opened the border to truck traffic from Mexico.\nThey do not inspect the incoming containers like we do. So a terrorist group could load a container with anything and ship it to Mexico to be transferred to a truck that is going to somewhere in the states and just drive it across the border in San Diego or Texas. Then in just a few days it could be sitting right in-front of the Washington monument and pull the trigger on some big bomb Boom Boom Washington DC.

Please somebody tell me how to accomplish this in my swing.,This is probably one of the most difficult things to stop doing for most golfers. One that may help is to think about keeping your right elbow (assuming you're a righty) closer to your body on your downswing.  This tends to promote more an inside out swing path.\n\nAlso, if you can maintain your shoulders in a level position, or have your left shoulder pointed slightly upwards, it will be difficult to get over the top as well.\n\nGood luck!

__label__4 , Physical Sciene question.?,1.   explain how you arrived at the answer in the case of a numerical problem. (The process is much more important than the answer, and there is not always one 'right' way to arrive at the answer.).\n\n1a.   What is the difference between distance and displacement? \n 1b.  Give an example of each (distance and displacement). \n\n 2.    Jack and Jill set out for a morning run. They both run 2 miles North along Rte 3 and then turn and run back South to home (to the starting point). Jill stops at home, but Jack continues to run South for an additional 3 miles to the gym. \n\na.    How far did Jill run? (Remember the defintion of distance.)\n b.    What was the displacement for her entire run? (Remember the definition of displacement.)\n c.    How far did Jack run? (Remember the definition of distance.)\n d.    What was the displacement for his entire run? (Remember the definition of displacement.),First off, distance is a measure of length. When you say that an object is 1 inch long, you are measuring the distance from one of it to the other.\n\nWhen you hear that a space object is X light years from earth, the X light years also represent distance, specifically the number of kilometers light will travel in that amount of time. Since light is so fast that it travels about 186,000 miles per second & since space is so large, it is more convenient to measure distance in space using the distance (the # of miles) light will travel in 1 year then multiply that by a number of years that will give you at least an estimate of how far that object is from earth.\n\nWhile distance is a measurement, displacement, on the other hand, is a rate. When you hear a car was going 100 miles an hour, that is a rate. A 100 miles between two given cities is just the distance between them. But travelling (on foot, on a bicycle, on a motorcycle, by car, by train, by boat, by plane or by any other means) X units of distance (10 kilometers, 300 miles, 50 yards, 2 inches etc.) in Y units of time (30 seconds, 4 minutes, 5 hours, 6 days, 9 weeks, 8 months, 2 years, 1 decade (= 10 years), 4 centuries (1 century = 100 years), or 3 millenia (1 millenium = 1000 years)) then that is a rate.\n\nDisplacement is a rate of change, not merely a ratio between two things, such as a ratio of distance to time.\nDisplacement indicates the change in position, relative to the point of origin & the destination.\n\nIn the example you provide, if Jill moves from point A to point B, then she has travelled a distance of X units, X being the length between them. If she moves from point A to point B then back, then she went back over the distance she already covered. So, in this example, her displacement is 0, because she went over the same length she already covered.\n\nAnother way to look at this is by using a boomerang as an example. If you throw a boomerang, it will always come back to you. Suppose you threw it & it travelled 10 feet then came back. It is said to have travelled 20 feet (10 one way & 10 on the way back) but to have a displacement of 0 because, relative to its starting position & its destination, it returned to the starting point & so it isn't considered to have shifted its position. The distance it travells is irrelevant.\n\nAnother way to look at it is if you go on a trip, say a 1-day fishing trip. Suppose you go to a lake that's 100 miles from where you live. You go there, you stop, you fish & do whatever, then return home. You travelled a total of 200 miles in that day. But, does that mean that just because you travelled those 200 miles then you moved & you now live in a different home at a different address? Of course not.\n\nBut, if you stopped for gas on the way, then your displacement equals the extra distance you travelled to get to the gas station.\n\nSo, onto your questions:\n\n2.    Jack and Jill set out for a morning run. They both run 2 miles North along Rte 3 and then turn and run back South to home (to the starting point). Jill stops at home, but Jack continues to run South for an additional 3 miles to the gym.\n\na. How far did Jill run? (Remember the definition of distance.)\n\nJill ran 4 miles.\n\nb. What was the displacement for her entire run? (Remember the definition of displacement.)\n\nHer displacement for her entire run was 0.\n\nc. How far did Jack run? (Remember the definition of distance.)\n\nJack ran 7 miles.\n\nd. What was the displacement for his entire run? (Remember the definition of displacement.)\n\nHis displacement for his entire run was 3 miles, the distance from the starting point (home) to the gym.\n\nI hope that helped.
__label__10 , Prison or Rehabilitation??,Take a drug addict for instance...\nIts so much cheaper to put him/her on a rehabilitation scheme that to lock em up.\nAnd you might say it doesnt achieve any but for many people neither does prison,There are two issues going on. \n\nFirst the American people have lost all respect for the law.  Prohibition in the 20s did a great deal to change people's opinions of laws and turn respect for the law into a joke.  The 55 mph speed limit and the laws against drugs like Marajuana have removed all traces of respect for the law from most people. \n\nLaw enforcement itself is oppressive against the poor. The poor are not protected by cops, they need protection from cops. \n\nThird you have to reform the crooks running the justice system to have a chance at reforming the inhabitents of the justice system. How can prison inmates watching wardens taking bribes, often loading food paid for by the prison system or goods made in the system into private trucks to be sold for the benifit of the Warden's personal pocketbook? Now try to tell them to go honest. Minor crimes wind up imprisoned with hardened crimanals.  The system itself creates immense anger among the incarcerated. \n\nNext most who go in because of drugs are not really there because of a drug problem. They might have been caught selling drugs. Might have had a large quanity of drugs. The reality is that most people are quite happy and in control of their drug habits. The exceptions being the more addictive drugs like crack and herion.  Changing the environment and screening for those with real addictions will make more sense. The guy in prison for weed probably has no drug problem, instead they have education, anti-authority and economic problems. So if you get him to quit smoking weed you just changed the crime not the problem. \n\nSo the first reform would be to ban lawyers from writing laws. Many people are in trouble with the law and even prison for laws they could not understand or for laws they felt were unjust. \n\nEconomically roads need to be there for alterntive means out of poverty. There will always be those who take the quick money, but the majority of people are in crime because of socio or economic reasons. They grow up with cops on their backs even when they are doing nothing wrong. Their friends, relitives, often parents going back multiple generations are in prison or ex-cons. It's become a family tradition and in some neighborhoods it's expected to do time sooner or later. That or die on the street. You have to break up that social acceptance of crime. While laws are unjust and enforcement so heavy against the poor it will be construed as racism and as oppression. There has to be legitimate outs for such people and changing the social jail from one with bars to one without bars doesn't change the incarceration. \n\nPrisons are a manifestation of corruption in this nation. They cost us dearly. Every person spends probably %10-20 of their income dealing with the way we handle law in this nation and it's enforcement. Publicly people like our last two presidents are openly bought. Corporations like Microsoft openly taunt the world with illegal activties. Well known celeberties commit felonies and walk away to write books about how they got away with it. How then can you tell a youngster not to steal? Not to do what the big crooks are doing?  With a cops thieving, beating and harrassing those around them. With a school system that attempts to dehumanize it's patrons and offers little actual useful skills for work and career. With college nothing but a dream for so many in this nation. Jobs scarce and the fragmentation of our ethnic, religious and political groups. It's a wonder anybody who starts poor bothers to ever get a job. Then when released an offender comes out with nothing, knowing nobody sometimes but other offenders and with limited job opportunities. Of course they are going to get into more trouble. \n\nI agree totally with you about it being better to rehabilitate. However to rehabilitate you have to take care of the root causes. As our economy crumbles crime will shoot up again. As tensions increase between various

I know a lot of lawyers tell you never take one, because they are so inconclusive and some people get so nervous, every question is screwed up and can make you look guilty.  \n\nWhen the camera is on him sometimes he looks guilty.

Their downfall is, surprisingly, going to be their depth and ignorance. Chelsea has the MOST stocked midfield in European football. Because of this great young players have missed out on developing like Shaun Wright-Phillips and Joe Cole, who are crucial for England's National Team success in the future. These players would be starters on any other team and they will eventually leave to get their starting gigs. And Jose Mourinho will get canned next year after another dissapointing Champions League exit and his refusal to sign a world-class striker and stay with an immensely inferior Drogba. Also Man U and Arsenal are developing some great YOUNG teams.

You can drink a glass of salt and water as warm as you can stand it. Or you can do as others have said stick your finger down the back of your throat and you will start to gag and throw up.  You can do that several times until you feel better.
__label__10 , In Maryland, how far does a lit charcoal grill need to be away from an apartment building?,Specifically, in Montgomery County.  I know one cannot cook on a balcony.  A neighbor of mine is constantly grilling outside of my apartment.,The use of charcoal burning, other fuel burning or electric cooking equipment outside of any multi-family dwelling shall be prohibited unless such cooking equipment is at least twenty (20) feet from every part of the building.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to townhouses, row houses or other multi-family dwellings where all dwelling units are side by side and none are superimposed above another.
__label__4 , What do linguistics study and why?,,Linguists study language and the meaning of words.\n\nOne of the most fascinating classes I took in college was Philosophy of Linguistics thru the school's philosophy dept. \n\nIf you want to really know HOW people think...and really try to get a grasp around language and how it affects thinking and understanding...take a lingustics course. I don't mean oo sounds versus eww sounds or anything like that. \n\nI mean examining questions like If an ethnic group has 17 different words for types of snow...does that group look at snow in a different way than a group that has one word for 'snow'.\n\nOr If a group has no word for 'birthday' or 'birth date', what does that say linguistically about their concept of time and age? \n\nMaybe this answer is way over the edge..a bit ethereal...or, maybe it will kinda 'click' with someone....

__label__1 , Have you awakened the Buddha within, how so?,Look at this link: http://www.tibet.ca/en/wtnarchive/2002/12/9_5.html,Yes, I studied Buddhism for a while. However, I found the idea of trying to rise above suffering through enlightenment impractical and detrimental to growth.\n\nI have bounced many philosophies and religions through my mind and heart. Catholicism is my home. There I see the utter joy that suffering brings because it causes growth and redemption. Furthermore, the middle path as Buddha described it leaves one struggling to fight the river when really one should embrace the current and follow its flow. God asks us for extraordinary things from our life. To do great deeds and love big. Middle of the road is pleasure for one's self only.

But King's has a deadline coming up! I wouldn't find out about the scholarships until June, what do I do...? I love the idea of York (I spent a year at Durham and adored it), but who can resist London?,why can't you apply for both? You need to go to both departments and check out there facilities and what the people are like. Also, see what you can find out about what research is coming out of each of them. The more they're producing and getting pulished in better journals, the better. Its not just about the city, its about the quality of the research you'll be doing.

__label__3 , Question about down there?,In the past week or so I have had an uncomfortable burning down there. It is not so much in my actualy vagina, but around where my urine comes out.  It doesn't really hurt, but its uncomfortable. I called somewhere and was going to have them check it out. I told them that I was on my period, would that affect it. She said they could test for gonnarhea and chlamydia (no idea how to spell those), but not for a yeast infection. The woman said it would probably be best to wait until I was off my period. My quesiton is should I get an over the counter medication for yeast infection and see if that relieves the burning before I go pay money and get tested for those other things. Or should I just wait and go get tested?,If it burns when you urinate, it may be a urinary tract infection.  For vaginitis, my friend used Desitin (spelling approximate) ointment.  If it is vaginitis, wait until after your period to get tested for that or to try treatment from the over the counter ointment.\n\nIf it is vaginitis, you are one of the 75% of women in America who get it at least once.
__label__2 , how far can the signals of a RF transmitter go?,,There are essentially two parameters to look at when trying to determine the range of an RF Transmitter:\n\nTransmit Power\n\n    Transmit power refers to the amount of RF power that comes out of the antenna port of the radio. Transmit power is usually measured in Watts, milliwatts or dBm. (For conversion between watts and dB see below.)\n\nReceiver sensitivity\n\n    Receiver sensitivity refers to the minimum level signal the radio can demodulate. It is convenient to use an example with sound waves; Transmit power is how loud someone is yelling and receive sensitivity would be how soft a voice someone can hear. Transmit power and receive sensitivity together constitute what is know as “link budget”. The link budget is the total amount of signal attenuation you can have between the transmitter and receiver and still have communication occur.

__label__1 , Which language is better/easier to learn: Japanese or Chinese?,,Chinese is more difficult, but it's more helpful.  Many Asian languages including Japanese and Korean are derived from Chinese.  So if you can write Chinese, even educated Japanese and Koreans can understand you.  Don't learn simplified Chinese for 2 reasons.  1) only people in China can read it and 2) it's incredibly ugly, and disrupts the traditional calligraphy of the characters.

But unlike dividends, bonus shares are usually tax-free. The end result is that the shareholder will now own more shares in the company.
__label__4 , what mamal lives in water that can weigh up to 45 kilograms and is indangered species?,son's school project,45 Kilograms sounds small - mammals living in water tend to be large, because they need insulation to counter the good conductor of heat that water is.

Unfortunately, women go for this stuff bigtime, again as proof of your love.

__label__2 , Why do people obsessively eat ice during iron deficiency anemia?,,This practice is called pica.  Other examples of pica include eating starch, dirt, and clay.  It is a big problem in children, those with developmental disorders, and pregnant women.  Right now nobody really understands why this is done, but there are risk factors, iron deficiency being one of them, but also othr mineral deficiencies.  There is also clearly a cultural aspect to this.  It is thought that people who suffer from pica tend to eat non-nutritive foods, becuase it is culturally acceptable, and it may be learned from someone else.\n\n\nYou can read more about pica here:\nhttp://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1798.htm

Braids can be done in many hundreds and thousands of styles. If you had it done and it didn't look exactly right, then pick a different style, or go to a different braider. As far as music choice goes, it is useless these days to limit your self to any one flavor, or exclude any flavor or style of music. If you listen long enough there is bound to be  something from every genera that will grab your attention. (that's why we have so many cross over artists coming out, they are trying to make a point)

Everyone tells me I should only have 1 for my case. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\n-E,it should really depend on your objectives.  if you have a good head financially, you would file single and claim 9 or 10.  your paychecks will be greater, but it will be up to you to invest that money so you can pay your taxes when they are due.\n\nif you file single and claim 1 (yourself), you will probably have a small refund or owe a small amount at the end of the year.  this, of course, is provided that you don't have any weird transactions.  (didn't buy/sell a house, no farm income, etc.)

__label__4 , How can i get into Boston University? What kind of GPA do i need?,,You might get a sense as to whether you would qualify for admission at Boston University by taking a look at their current enrollment statistics:\n\nAverage GPA:  3.49 \nAverage SAT:  1278 \nAverage ACT:  28\n\nAlso, check out their page for freshman applicants. It gives you application instructions, requirements and standards, critical dates, etc.\n\nhttp://www.bu.edu/admissions/apply/fresh_admissions.html\n\nIn general, besides good grades and standardized test scores, schools are looking for students who are well-balanced, involved in extra-curricular activities, and active in their communities. I don't know what year of high school you're in, but you might want to start reading some of the many books that are available. The earlier you start preparing, the better.\n\nOne last thing - try not to stress out too much! If you don't get into the college of your choice, it's not the end of the world. I didn't do that well in high school and didn't get into any of the schools I wanted to go to. I ended up doing two years of community college, getting really good grades, and transfering into a prestigious university. So do the best you can, but at the same time, try to relax and enjoy the process.\n\nFinally, here's a book that looks kind of interesting. It's designed for students who have a wide range of abilities, but aren't necessarily the cream of the crop academically. It gets terrific reviews:\n\nColleges That Change Lives: 40 Schools You Should Know About Even If You're Not a Straight-A Student\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Colleges-That-Change-Lives-Straight/dp/0140296166/\n\nGood luck!

__label__3 , How do you get rid of nervousness?,What ever the reason, is there anything you can do to get rid of that rock-in-the-gut feeling of being nervous?,Don't look for a quick solution like medications (unless if you consider your nervousness bad enough to need medications as a side treatment). The answer for the relief of nervousness, same as any other psychological problem, is to find out what is causing it. What goes through your mind when this is happening? Monitor your thought patterns. Don't try to change anything or think or feel differently, that only makes things worse. Your only job is to realise what is happening, what goes through your mind exactly. At times this will give you an instant relief. At other times the problem is much deeper and more chronic, and realising what you are thinking does not make the problem go away straight away. But even though you may not realise it, doing this will gradually make those forces inside you weaker and weaker everytime you monitor those thoughts. After a while you will realise that the nervousness is not that intense anymore and if you keep going it will be completely resolved. \n\nUsually monitoring your thoughts will give you MUCH MUCH more than you bargained for. Realising one little thing could lead to realising other things and before you know it you can have much more overall life satisfaction...
__label__9 , I found out my wife was cheating on me 8 months ago. I'm still debating should I stay or leave. Suggestions?,,WOW! 30 answers in 10 minutes!\n\nWell,my suggestion probably isn't going to instantaneously resolve the issue. I do believe that people deserve second chances though. You married for better or for worse. This is one of those worse moments. \n\nIf you love her and you feel like there is still hope for your future than try to the best you can to not ever bring it up again. If you have talked about it and found out the reason for her cheating and have made it known that it won't ever be tolerated again; this is about all you can do. Never bring the subject up again and don't threaten to leave because of it. If you threaten,you may as well mean it. There is no point in threatening if you're not going to follow through. All it does is adds confusion to an already unstable relationship.\n\nAlso,if you have children involved in this situation,consider them also. Is it worth causing them the embarrassment and the hurt that goes along with divorce?  \n\nI wish you luck and every happiness. If you love your wife though,tell her that you do. Treat her the way you used to when you first met. Go on dates. Take a walk in the park hand in hand. Simple things can really help heal a broken heart,  for you and for her.

The therapist pin pointed that we never connected emotionally ad were activity partners. I don't hate her and it bothers me to see her upset/cry. Sometimes we can even have a nice moment together on a friendly level.\n\nI'd like to hear from other who have been through divorce and how they felt about thier exs before and how they feel now.,I felt exactly as you do prior to leaving my husband.  I cared for him, but was not deep in love with him any longer due to the trouble in our marriage for such a long time that didn't seem to be changing.  He resented me terribly for leaving and then just continues to try to punish me through the kids.  But I've never been happier outside of the deceitful, devious things my ex does, to be apart from him.  I have dated since my marriage ended and am not dating currently and again I have never been happier.  My point... that you don't have to be with someone to be happy.  I understand how you feel when you say it bothers you to see her cry, but if you are not going to be able to reciprocate the love she has for you, better to let her go and find someone that will.  Her crying and pain will eventually stop.  If you have kids, think about them if you decide to split.  Do not use them as pawns to get to your spouse.  If they do, know there is nothing you can do, but to tell your kids the truth, depending on the age, and continue to let them know you love them.  In the long run they will know the truth.  My children are starting to move away from their father as when they go to visit him, he constantly says bad things about me.  I do not talk of him.  And hey he is the one with the live in girlfriend.  Ironic don't you think.  In that he is with someone, I don't care, and he is the one that pushes the kids away because he can't stop saying nasty things about me.  Good Luck to you in whatever you decide to do, it may take time, but everything will be ok.

Two out of 3 main parties have chosen new leaders recently & the next candidates for the top job for Labour & the Liberals are male.  \n\nHowever there are many excellent candidates further down the greasy pole and it seems likely that some of them will be challenging for the leadership role when Cameron & whoever succeeds Brown/Blair resigns.  You could then see 2 out of 3 major parties led by women.

__label__6 , Is it pointless to tune my SL65 to 680hp?,I recently bought a SL65 with 604hp and many people are telling me to Renntech it to 680 for about 12K. However, many people i know who own Ferraris or M6s who dont do anything to tune their car. Alot of people simply buy the fastest version of that particular model and dont do anything after market to it. I'm not going to take the car to the drag every day, but i see mustangs doing 8s 1/4s. Whats the point of the 604hp version of the SL if a mustang can easily beat you.,$12k for 80 more hp is a huge waste of money. First, that is an improvment in hp of about 13% over stock which you probably wouldn't be able to actually feel and which you could probably gte by doing some simple bolt on modifications like intake, exhaust, new spark plugs, a chip, etc. which would cost far less than $12K.\nIf you want to retain your warranty and the driveability/comfort you desire (especially if you bought an SL65) then you wouldn't necessarily do anything to modify it.\nAlso, a mustang would have to be dramatically modified to get into the 8s in 1/4 and I doubt that any of those mustangs in the 8s are actually street legal. \nIf you thought that the SL65 would be the fastest car ever than you may be a little confused. If you want an 8 second car then you should sell the SL and get a mustang and modify it. I would guarantee that it won't have the comfort, driveability and sophistication of the SL. Personally, as a daily driver I would much rather have the SL than the mustang.

What is more important is knowing what it is not.  Your doctors should be able to rule out serious heart, lung or other problems that my be the cause.  if you and your parents are still concerned about this seek a second opinion.  If at all possible, find a teaching hospital or pedeatric heart or lung specailist in your area for a consult.

In the center of the bore? Or is it uniform throughout?,Any ferromagnetic material would be attracted to a magnet. Maybe if your ferrite is big enough it may cause the magnet to quench (but I doubt it). The trick with MRI is to have a field gradient so that only a small volume of the specimen will be at resonance so the maximum flux points will vary as the scan proceeds.

I plan on calling him and starting out with Im going to send a check to refund you for the class becouse I did not do that well in it. then tell him everything after that. Any ideas.,Hi, Dad. Yeah, I'm calling you about that English class. I really appreciate that you paid for it, but despite doing my best I just couldn't understand it so rather than fail, I dropped out. I'll refund you all the money; I don't think it's fair for you to pay for something I didn't use.\n\nAnd then hit the books.
__label__4 , Do u think Illegal immigrants should be allowed to get in-state tuition rates?,I am trying to write an argumenative paper on postsecondary education and illegal immigrants,I'm not an American or an illegal alien so I have no attachment to this debate but it seems to me that the reason there is a difference between in and out state tuition is a result of one paying state taxes, correct?  That is, by paying state taxes, you subsidize your education giving a lower in-state tuition.\n\nThus, if you work in a state at a legal job (whether you had to result to identity theft/using fake SSN to get hired) or just by paying sales tax on your purchases you've EARNED the right to that subsidized in-state tuition.\n\nNow people may get angry and debate this for whatever emotional reason but since they've already paid, why can't they benefit as long as they've resided in the state long enough to qualify for in-state tuition?  It's not like you're giving them free money.  It's THEIR money as well.  Granted, they have no right to be in the country in the first place but by paying taxes and otherwise acting as responsible citizens they've paid for that subsidy.\n\n/end rant.  Don't know why I got worked up there but now I want to explore this issue further and write your paper!  j/k\n\nThat being said, this issue confuses me.  If you KNOW they're illegal, why aren't you shipping them home rather than wondering whether or not they should get in-state tuition and other benefits?  Canada may be easier to get in to but if they know you're illegal, au revoir!

__label__3 , longes penis known?,longest penis known in history,The largest erect member in medical literature would be the 14-inch organ mentioned by Dr. David Reuben in his book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (1969). Reuben didn’t divulge any source for this figure, and there was no independent verification, so you may question his accuracy. The largest medically verified penis on record is 13.5 inches long and 6.25 inches around, documented in the early twentieth century by Dr. Robert L. Dickinson. Other sources (Alfred Kinsey, Masters and Johnson, etc.) mention specimens ranging from 9.5 to 12 inches.\n\nThen there are the dubious claims of immense penis size by various personages operating within the sex industry (read: porn actors). These claims are almost invariably false, the result of exaggeration and hype by unscrupulous dealers hoping to hawk more products. Take the legendary Long Dong Silver, for instance. Made famous by the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, his one enduring trait was his supposedly 18-inch penis. Totally fraudulent, as it turns out; in fact, there are videos in which he appears only normal sized.

__label__6 , 2 RBs to Start?,Dominic Rhodes or DeAngelo Williams ... I also have Maurice Jones Drew and Warrick Dunn.\n\nIm gonna Start Dunn and I was leaning toward Rhodes,Your leaning towards the right guy!\n\nMJD is second behind F Taylor, and the fantastic week he just had, I think Taylor is going to continue seing the most plays in that team.\nWilliams is playing behind D Foster, also a good starter. And Williams isn't a good play this week, not strong enough or consistent enough. \nRhodes is playing behind an emerging Addai, but they both have about the same number of Carries. And the same low number of TD's. And I think they have to play it a bit safer this week with Philly, and run the ball more, so I think Rhodes and Addai will split the carries.\nSO out of your 3 second RB's I think you should pick Rhodes. \nYou should get the most out of him this week.\n\nGood Luck!

__label__8 , New Evanescence album any time soon?,,Evanescence is currently working on their second album, the title of which isn't yet known. The album has progressed slowly for a number of reasons, but perhaps chiefly because of Amy Lee's desire to allow the creative process to fully take its course and not rush production. Besides that, other distractions have included other band members' side projects, health problems concerning guitarist Terry Balsamo and the controversy revolving around the dismissal of their former manager. Lee stated on EvBoard that Evanescence's new album will be wrapping up in March 2006. It should be on store shelves in late summer, with the tentative release date rumored to be August 22nd. However, recently the wife of Rocky Gray (the band's drummer) has posted news on another fan board, stating that the release will be pushed back to sometime in September, allegedly because Wind-Up [the band's current record label] wants to make a few changes to the upcoming single.\n\n\nAfter a long period of stasis, the Evanescence website was updated with a short piece of news. The news read Evanescence is in the studio working on new music. Check back to the site for more info as it becomes available.

Serious answers only please.  Anyone worked with someone like that?  Any warnings or what not to do's?  Thanks,Hey SonoranAngel you just answered one of my questions so I thought I'd help you out here. I too suffer from schizophrenia ( as you know) and it has always helped me when others seriously listen and consider what I have to say. I know they probably taught you this but their is usually a logical reason for the individuals fears, worries, bizzarethoughts, etc. However that can take quite a bit of time so what you could do in the meantime is try and get the individual psychiatric treatment (meds) as well as listen. Even if it makes no sense to you. As long as the individual isn't hurting anyone (including himself) go along with what he's saying and try to help him come to some logical conclusion, (reality testing). This has always helped to ground me even when I'm in my more manic stages. Please don't tell the individual that his thoughts and feelings aren't valid based on YOUR perceptions of what normal is. This has always managed to become more of a hinderance to my well being than anything else. Plus it's really annoying. Make sure the individual \ngets their meds, this can greatly increase their reasoning ability, I know this from personal experience. BTW my grandmother used to think she was Mary, Jesus's mother. And I'd be the first to say that she has lead a fairly successful life as well as dealt with her mental disorder ina very positive manner. NEVER view an individual as hopeless. There is Hope for all of us.

Some boys are really shy though, so if you feel that he's staring at you, look at him and if he turns away really quick, he likes you! And some boys don't really like showing how he feels toward girls to their face, so just ask some people. If you ready for the last solution though, just ask him! It's really not that hard cause 9 times out of 10, they'll ask you the same question to see if you like them. And if he doesn't like you, WHOA (sarcastically) It's not the end of the world! So don't freak out, because there's plenty of more dudes out there that are looking for a girl just like you! (I'm serious!)

I also think about the death row prisoner in Texas who, on the day before his execution, managed to take a drug overdose. They rushed him to the hospital, saved his life, then brought him back to prison and killed him. Apparently, just to piss him off.,the reason is there is always a chance that the person will get a pardon or will be found innocent at the last moment, letting someone die in jail is perceived as cruel and unusual punishment.  All prisoners are the responsibility of the prison where they are housed. It is an odd and stupid system.

Formerly Dayton Hudson Corporation, Target has three main retail divisions: Target Stores, Mervyn's, and Marshall Field's. Target Stores is the number two discount retailer in the country, trailing only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and has distinguished itself from its competitors by offering upscale, fashion-conscious products at affordable prices. The 1,225 Target stores, which are located in 47 states, generated 84 percent of Target's fiscal 2002 revenues. Included in this store count are Target Greatland units, which are much larger than the typical Target store, averaging 145,000 square feet versus 126,000 square feet; as well as SuperTarget outlets, which are combined discount/grocery stores, averaging 175,000 square feet. Generating 9 percent of 2002 revenues were Mervyn's 267 stores situated in 14 states, primarily in the West, Southwest, and Midwest (specifically Minnesota and Michigan). Based in the San Francisco Bay area, Mervyn's positions itself as a chain of moderately priced, family friendly, neighborhood department stores. Target Corporation's full-service department store division, contributor of 6 percent of sales, is now consolidated under the Marshall Field's banner. The 62 Marshall Field's stores (which include locations that formerly operated under the Dayton's and J.L. Hudson's names) are located in eight states in the upper Midwest, with the majority found within three metropolitan areas: Minneapolis, Chicago, and Detroit. Target Corporation's philanthropy has been and still is legendary. In 1989 the corporation received the America's Corporate Conscience Award for its magnanimity, and Target contributes more than $2 million each week to the communities in which its stores are located.\n\nEarly Years\n----------------------------\nTarget Corporation bears the strong imprint of its founder, George Draper Dayton. Dayton's father, a physician in New York state, could not afford to send him to college, in part because the doctor freely gave his services to the poor. Hence Dayton set off on his own in 1873 at age 16 to work in a coal and lumberyard. A workaholic, he undermined his health and a year later had to return to the family home to recuperate. Undeterred, he went on to become a banker. Less than ten years later, in 1883, he was rich enough to buy the Bank of Worthington in Minnesota. Meanwhile he had married and had become active in the Presbyterian Church.\n\nDayton's connection with the Presbyterian Church proved to be instrumental to the rise of his Dayton Company. In 1893, the year of a recession that sent local real estate prices tumbling, the Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis burned down. The insurance did not cover the cost of a new building, and the only other source of income, a corner lot next to the demolished church, was unsalable because the real estate market was doing poorly. The congregation prevailed on the Dayton family, who were faithful members of the church, to purchase it so the building of a new church could proceed. Dayton bought it and eventually erected a six-story building on the lot. Casting about for tenants, he decided to buy the nearby Goodfellow Dry Goods store and set it up in the new building. In the spring of 1902 the store was known as the Goodfellow Dry Goods store; in 1903 the corporate name was changed to Dayton Dry Goods Company, then seven years later simply Dayton Company, the forerunner of Dayton Hudson Corporation and, ultimately, Target Corporation.\n\nEventually the store would expand to fill the six-story edifice. Dayton, with no previous experience in the retail trade, wielded tight control of the company until his death in 1938. His principles of thrift and sobriety and his connections as a banker enabled the company to grow. As long as he was at the helm, the store was run as a fami

__label__2 , if every action has an equal an opposite reaction, then how does a man move a box along the floor?,There is an answer to this, just that it hasn't occured to me yet! Any help would be appreciated.,The man is pushing against the box in one direction, and against the floor (with an equal force) in the opposite direction. The force on the floor is transmitted through his shoes, via a frictional force. And the man experiences reaction forces in his hands and feet (the box and the floor pushing back)\n\nWhen stationary, or at constant velocity, all the forces balance. As the box starts to move (accelerate), there must be a resultant force in the forward direction, i.e. the forces are not balanced.

__label__6 , Ideas for making a fantasy football league more fun?,I'm the commissioner of a fantasy football league that consists of 10 current and former coworkers and their spouses.  We had to do an autodraft since some people live far away now and that wasn't as much fun as our live drafts previously.  There's less smack talk and there was no trading this year and, of course, some people are already clearly out of it.  Our league is a great bunch of people but I'm afraid with it being less fun this year no one's going to want to play next year and we'll start to really lose touch with one another.  \n\nSo does anyone have any things they do or ideas (please keep them clean) to keep the leagues fun and keep a league together?,One idea I used for my fantasy league is to do a keeper league. There are many variations for this; here's the one I used. Each team participates in the inital draft. Once the season finishes, each team can choose to retain up to 4 players. The rest get funneled into the draft for next year. For next year's draft, the teams will mandatorially draft the (up to) four they retained. The rest will be put into a new draft, etc. etc. Another way to make FF fun is to put a wager on it, such as a March Madness office pool, or something akin to that. Hope I could help.

He then get an habbit of being in her company that he enjoys a kind of sexually. To get that pleasure the boy cares about everything relating to girls life. Therefore his understanding whether he loves her or not totally gets masked with the feeling that he cares for her. He gives name to this habbit asbeing in love with her. The girl can be close to boy for the reason that he gives her sexual pleasure and also cares for other things in her life. But she possibly does not love him. Since she stops showing her love to him after she came to know that boys parents does not consider as a good girl. Does she ever loved him or is not the boy is wrong in saying he loved her.,

__label__3 , Any experience with the 'bright light therapy'?,If you have SAD...,Light therapy, or phototherapy, is the administration of doses of bright light in order to treat a variety of sleep and mood disorders. It is most commonly used to re-regulate the body’s internal clock and/or relieve depression.\n\nWhen used to treat SAD or other forms of depression, light therapy has several advantages over prescription antidepressants. Light therapy tends to work faster than medications, alleviating depressive symptoms within two to 14 days after beginning light therapy as opposed to an average of four to six weeks with medication. And unlike antidepressants, which can cause a variety of side effects from nausea to concentration problems, light therapy is extremely well tolerated. Some side effects are possible with light but are generally not serious enough to cause discontinuation of the therapy. There are several other different applications for light therapy, including:\n• Full-spectrum/UV light therapy for disorders of the skin. A subtype of light therapy that is often prescribed to treat skin diseases, rashes, and jaundice.\n• Cold laser therapy. The treatment involves focusing very low-intensity beams of laser light on the skin, and is used in laser acupuncture to treat a myriad of symptoms and illnesses, including pain, stress, and tendinitis.\n• Colored light therapy. In colored light therapy, different colored filters are applied over a light source to achieve specific therapeutic effects. The colored light is then focused on the patient, either with a floodlight which covers the patient with the colored light, or with a beam of light that is focused on the area of the illness.\n• Back of knee light therapy. A 1998 report published in the journal Science reported that the area behind the human knee known as the popliteal region contains photoreceptors that can help to adjust the body’s circadian rhythms. The authors of the study found that they could manipulate circadian rhythms by focusing a bright light on the popliteal region. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of this treatment on disorders such as SAD and jet lag.

__label__1 , Is the US College Admissions  process racist? Serious Question-- read my story.?,Look. I don't usually believe that much racism exists in things like college admissions anymore, but even my patience has been tested this time. I am of Arab descent and I was denied from every US college that I applied to except my safety school. I have a 4.00 GPA from the best school in Louisisna, I keep a job, I've done many extracurricular activities (ranging from community service to political campaigning), I've lived in 3 different countries, and I have a 1400 SAT score. Aside from this, I had outstanding teacher recommendations and I spent 2 weeks writing my college essay, having it checked over  and over by teachers, who all rated it very highly. There was one college in particular that accepted every applicant from my school, except me. Some of the kids that were accepted in my place were white/Jewish, had around 3.3 GPA's, kept few extracurriculars, and had similar SAT scores. Doesn't this seem all too coincidental to you? The same thing happened to my dad 20 years ago.,Honestly, I'm not surprised. I would like to say that our colleges are not racist...  but unfortunately, I think it is too likely that they are.  I regret to say that on my massively large campus, I have never heard any student speak up when teachers asked if there were any people of Islamic faith present, and there are very few people who appear to be of Arab descent.\n\nI absolutely believe that racism in America is not a black and white issue anymore.  African Americans have --luckily-- been able to campaign for improved access and acceptance, as have Asian-Americans. To some degree there also appears to be better access for people of Hispanic decent and (perhaps to a lesser degree) Native Americans.   However, I think that just as in WWII there was an upswell in prejudice against people of all Asian extraction, I think now there is an upswell in prejudice against people of all Arab descent.\n\nI also know that federal financial aid throws up major road blocks for all people of Arab descent whose names reflect their heritage.  I had a close friend who worked for Sallie Mae and reported that loans were consistently frozen for review for all people whose names were substantially similar to anything on the terrorist watch list -- including numerous common Arab first and last names, either of which could get someone frozen.\n\nI am sorry and ashamed of this...   *sigh*\n\nI'm not sure what good it will do to challenge these decisions, or if you feel prepared to do that, but know that there are people out here who were born into White America and still would support your right to equality in all ways.  \n\nI wish you the best of luck.
__label__9 , Will i be accepted or not?,I like a lot  a Sikh boy, i don´t have any religion and i´m not an Indian Girl...i´m asking me is his parents and his family will accept me?,Hey dear friend...\n\nIf u can beleave your self, you can beleave him.\n\nIn india we have many religions, communities.

__label__2 , What is the exact cause of a stitch?,(The sort you get when you're running, walking, doing lots of exercise, etc.),A side stitch is a piercing sensation just below the ribcage, usually felt when you're running. In the past, several different theories tried to explain the cause: trapped gas, swollen liver, stomach muscle cramps. However a recent and fairly conclusive theory holds that strain on the ligaments connecting the liver to the diaphragm is the cause. \nThe liver hangs from the diaphragm by fibrous bands called ligaments. Running exerts a steady downward force on your liver, stretching these ligaments. In addition, when you exhale (usually as your left foot hits the ground), your diaphragm is pushed up. That means your liver falls with gravity as your diaphragm rises, placing considerable strain on those poor ligaments. \n\nThe result? A stitch. The cure? Stop running immediately and press your hand just below the pain. This should raise your liver up, relieving the strain on the ligaments. Inhale and exhale evenly as you press down. \n\nAs a preventive measure, take deep, full breaths while running. If you take shallow breaths, your diaphragm is consistently raised, which wreaks havoc on your ligaments. Exercise is great, but remember to be kind to the rubber bands keeping your organs in place.

__label__1 , if your teenager?,chooses a friend of the opposite sex that you do not approve of do you as a parent enter into conflict with them or do you discuss the issue in an open and friendly manner,You invite your teenagers friend to your house as often as possible and try to be a positive influence on the friend. By having them to your house, you can tell if you really should disapprove of the friend or not. If you say something negative about the friend, you will labeled as the old person who just doesn't know how things are today. By having the friend to your house and being kind towards the friend, you will look like the good guy in the eyes of your teenager and, if the friendship lasts more than a few weeks, you will be in a much stronger position to question certain aspects of the friend that you disapprove of.

__label__7 , where do returns on foreign investments come from? What generates the wealth?,,Foreign investments work just like any other kind of investments.  The only difference is that changes in currency value can have an added impact, either plus or minus.\n\nAn investment in a company increases in value when more people want to buy the stock.  Supply and demand interaction pushes the stock price up.  What's behind that?  People normally want to buy a stock when it is earning profits and increasing profits.  If the company is making enough money, it may also pay dividends out of those profits.\n\nBusiness is what generates the wealth, plain and simple.

For more than 30 years now the UN has been working on a new international economic order without appreciable success. The sad event of september 11 2001 in the US has changed the US view of international development. The US now has a new national security strategy with 3 pillars, Defense, Diplomacy and Development. The UK suffered a similar fate july 7 2005, ironically while the UK government was busy urging the 2005 G8 summit to take Africa poverty more seriously. The UK is also working on a new international developmenbt white paper 2006, expected to be released this summer. Regretfully the UK is not doing enough to implement the UK Commission for Africa report march 2005, to identify, promote and protect African and Non African professionals who have ideas, innovation and entrepreneurship required to effectively tackle poverty. Momentum generated in the UK last year is lost, yet tackling poverty is in the common interest of the globe.,Just ask one question at a time please..\n\nBy just eliminating the transnational companies, be careful not international or multinational ones, poverty can be defeated for 128 years

__label__10 , If Martial Law Was Declared in the United States, could the the president suspend a national election ?,,United States of America\nThe martial law concept in the U.S. is closely tied with the Writ of habeas corpus, which is in essence the right to a hearing on lawful imprisonment, or more broadly, the supervision of law enforcement by the judiciary. The ability to suspend habeas corpus is often equated with martial law. Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution states, The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\n\nIn United States law, martial law is limited by several court decisions that were handed down between the American Civil War and World War II. In Ex Parte Milligan 71 US 2 1866, the Supreme Court of the United States held that martial law could not be instituted within the United States when its civilian courts are in operation. In 1878, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval. The National Guard is an exception, since unless federalized, they are under the control of state governors. [5]

I feel a strong presence all over and all body functions are gone I can feel myself trying hard to move but I cant. I know I'm not sleeping yet because after just a minute or two of this I can finally move my fingers then my arms and so on. I then readjust and try to fall back asleep or start to walk about the house then go back to bed.,You have just explained exactly what i go through at least once per week. It is the scariest thing for me. No matter how hard i try i just cant move even though i know im not asleep.\n\nI looked into this condition awhile ago. Its a safety mechanism your brain will sometimes paralise your body so you don't hurt yourself while asleep. The only problem is sometimes its faulty. Somehow this don't make me feel any better. lol\n\nBest thing to do is just ignore it and go back to sleep. Thats what i do.\n\nThe only thing that really scares me about all this is, what if there is a home invasion or a fire starts and you can't move to get out.

Buy a network capable printer.  They run about $200-$300.\n\n2.  Install the printer on one machine and print through that machine.  It's really a pain in the arse, which was why I always recommend having a networked printer when you have two or more PC's.  Windows does not always recognize the printer on that other machine.\n\nYou can have as many printers as you have network connections available if they are all part of the network.\n\nAlternatively, you can hook up each printer as a loal printer to each individual machine.

__label__9 , Does blood relation always  justify mother-son relationship?,There are many unfortunate children in this world who do not get mother's love inspite of having their own mother.There are many woman who are more intersted in money matters ,job,parties etc. than taking care of their own children.At times we come across wicked mothers who use slangs in their house and teach their kids politics,witchcraft.Instead of teaching moral values they ask their kids to be dishonest to others,jelous of others.They always try to confine their children's future into darkness,limited to her guide-lines so that she can have full control and vigil when they grow up,so that they only follow her instructions even when they grow up.In that case if some other lady showers love on that \ndeprived child,is she not worth to be recalled as that childs mother?,No, it does not always justify a mother/child relationship. If there is some other lady, unfortunately they have a very hard time, if not impossible, being mom because they are not the genetic mother who is there all the time. Unfortunately there are people out there like you describe, but we really can't do anything about it. Now if murder was legal,,,,,,

__label__9 , ok, i have a boyfriend, Im really really happy with him but I wish I could have a best friend to hang out with,The past 4 years I've been a loner, and I know I've missed out on alot and i barely have this boyfriend i go to college with and I feel happy, but he's a guy and I really wish I could have a friend to just hang out with, but gosh it's soo hard i only go to school 2 times a week!! Help? how can i make friend? or meet (hopefully) a best friend, or should i be happy with my boyfriend??? Help????????????,I would tell you that you should get involved in some school activities to meet people.  You think it's hard now, wait until later!  It gets even harder when you're out of school.  I can tell you from personal experience because I was with a guy of 8 years, we moved all around the country, and I lost touch with everyone I knew.  Now I'm back here in my home town and I'm lucky to have been able to hunt down 2 of my old friends.  I'm not with the guy I was with for 8 years anymore and I have no idea how and when I'll meet my next boyfriend because I don't know very many people.  \n\nMoral of the story.. make friends now, make GOOD friends, who are gonna be around for a long time. You have no idea how things will end up with your guy, if things don't work out and you have no friends to get you out of the house you'll be so miserable.  Just remember, it only gets harder as you get older to meet new people.  Do it now.  You'll be a better girlfriend for it, too, because you won't be relying on your guy to entertain you or go do such and such with you all the time.  That was an issue between my ex and I as the years passed, it was really hard on him.  It was hard on me, too.  I went shopping with my friends the other day and I realized how awesome it was to have someone to help me pick out clothes to buy and to run back and forth and grab different sizes for me so I didnt' have to keep going in and out of the dressing room.  Little things.  There are subjects that you just can't talk about w/ your guy, they dont' understand.  It's all about the little things and you will really appreciate having a friend around.  You can never have too many!

__label__7 , Historically speaking?   Why is GOLD valuable?   Is it a cure for something or does it just look cool?,,At this point, I would argue that it is valuable because it is a traditional holdover from 5000 years ago or more.  The neat thing about gold is that it has historically had the same basic purchasing power.  In ancient Egypt several thousand years ago, a one ounce gold coin would buy a nice suit of clothes - same today.  Also, for centuries, gold was the common currency around most of the world.  Even if your coin had the image of the wrong emperor on it, it could be melted down and re-cast for similar value.  Many central banks settled nations' debts in gold until recently.  Most went off the gold standard between WWII and the early 1970's.\n\nInvestors still flee to gold when they feel there will be high inflation in the near future, Gold is used in some tech products (CRT computer monitors for example) and some Central Banks still maintain gold reserves - hence the majority of its value as an investment today.\n\nHope this helps.

__label__4 , anciant eygypt help?,how was the great pyrimid of giza made (khufu)?,Please visit this site, it has more details, i am including some of it here:\n\nThe Pyramids. According to common perception they were built, with the begrudging help of great armies of slaves, by the ancient pharaohs of Egypt as tombs for preserving their royal bodies. Pyramids were meant to be monuments to the pharaoh's greatness, filled with great treasures for the afterlife. To construct these massive shrines, the pharaoh's copied the oldest and largest pyramid of all, the Great Pyramid of Giza.\nBut the Great Pyramid itself contains no pharaoh's body, no treasure chamber, and no treasures. Who, then, designed it and built it? What was its purpose? Let us begin our tour by considering a few basic facts about the Great Pyramid.\n\n\n The Last Wonder of the World\n\nThirty times larger than the Empire State Building, the Pyramid's features are so large they can be seen from the Moon.\nIts base covers 13.6 acres (equal to seven midtown Manhatten city blocks), each side being greater than five acres in area.\nA highway lane eight feet wide and four inches thick could be built from San Francisco to New York and put inside the Great Pyramid.\nThe oldest structure in existence, having been started 4,617 years ago, it is the sole remnant of the Seven Wonders of the World.\n Journey to the Center of the Earth\n\nOnly a solid stone mountain could endure the Pyramid's immense weight. And indeed, a flat solid granite mountain happens to be located just beneath the surface of the ground directly under the Pyramid.\nIt is built to face true North.\nThe Pyramid is located at the exact center of the Earth's land mass. That is, its East-West axis corresponds to the longest land parallel across the Earth, passing through Africa, Asia, and America. Similarly, the longest land meridian on Earth, through Asia, Africa, Europa, and Antarctica, also passes right through the Pyramid. Since the Earth has enough land area to provide 3 billion possible building sites for the Pyramid, the odds of it's having been built where it is are 1 in 3 billion.\n Construction Unequaled by Modern Technology\n\nLike 20th century bridge designs, the Pyramid's cornerstones have balls and sockets built into them. Several football fields long, the Pyramid is subject to expansion and contraction movements from heat and cold, as well as earthquakes, settling, and other such phenomena. After 4,600 years it's structure would have been significantly damaged without such construction.\nWhile the bulk of the Pyramid's core was constructed of 4,000- to 40,000-pound blocks of soft limestone, the outer layer of the Pyramid was made of a beautifully bright, protective layer of polished stone. These outer casing stones are missing today because about 600 years ago they were stolen by Arabs, (This accounts for the very worn appearance of the Pyramid today, since the inner limestone blocks are not immune to attack by the elements-wind, rain, and sandstrom.) This protective covering was made up of 100-inch-thick, 20-ton block of hard, white limestone, similar to marble but superior in hardness and in durability against the elements.\n\nThe Great Pyramid did not always look as rough as it does today.\nOriginally it was encased with a layer of tight-fitting, highly polished 20-ton stone slabs.\n\nThe casing stones, 144,000 in all, were so brilliant that they could literally be seen from the mountains of Israel hundreds of miles away. On bright mornings and late afternoons, sunlight reflected by this vast mirrored surface of 5-1/4 acres distinguished the Pyramid as being visible from the moon. (Note: For those interested in possible symbolic significance, in Bible prophecy 144,000 is the number of people-12,000 from each of the 12 tribes of Israel-who are supposed to evangelize the world at the endtime.)\nThe people of the area had viewed the Pyramid and its polished stones with awe for centuries. But when a 13

In the pursuit of making some earrings, I inhaled a very small amount of dust into my lungs.  I could immedietly taste the calcium (similar taste and smell to your teeth getting drilled) and became nausious.  After about fifteen minutes I was having a hard time breathing altogether and ended up going to the hospital.  The doctors said that the dust has very small amounts of toxin in it, as does the meat of the abalone and both are extremely dangerous in large amounts.\n\nso my advice to you, and this is what i do now, is to wear a simple gas mask.  The gas mask I chose to get was roughly $60 and I have had absolutely no problems since i bought it.  When it comes to one's health, you can never be to careful or too cheap.

Do your reaction towards a negative comment reflect your race?,I don't know of anyone that likes a negative comment. Some are more vocal in their disapproval of a negative comment than others. As far as race is concerned I believe that would have to do with bad things that have been done in the past and unfortunately are still going on today. A negative comment that is derived from past or present wrongs would render a bad or hurt feeling in a person of a race or group of people that had suffered the wrongdoing. But this same feeling can also be rendered in someone that is not of that race or group due to their sensitivity of the feelings of the person offended. As far as a case study statistic I don't have one. But I deal with people of all walks of life on a daily basis, and I have yet to see one person respond happily to a negative comment.

(so A is true)\n\nI think B is false because van der waals forces involve gravitation pull between particles, not anything to do with charge. so particles only attract each other.\n\nmy book also says a real gas consists of atoms or molecules that have finite volumes. therefor, the volume available to a given particle in a real gas is less then the volume of the container because the gas particles themselves take up some of the space. to account for the discrepency, van der waals represented the actual volumes as shown in the equation. n is the number of moles of gas and b is an empirical constant.\n(that's too wordy for me to comprehend, so C and D are your call)

Intoxicants and Gambling,\n(Dedication of) stones, And (divination by) arrows,Are an Abomination – Of Satan’s handiwork; Eschew such (abomination),T hat ye may prosper.[Al-Qur’an 5:90]\n                                 \n\n\n2.   Prohibition of alcohol in the Bible\n\nThe Bible prohibits the consumption of alcohol in the following verses:\n\n   1. Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging; and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.\n      [Proverbs 20:1]\n   2. And be not drunk with wine.\n                            [Ephesians 5:18]
__label__1 , When a believer comes on this forum are they trying to convert unbelievers or fellowship with believers?,Because atheist are trying to convert believers to unbelief.  So if this is your reason doesn't it seem to be a battle of wills?  and who will win?,The Atheists offer nothing to convert me to.  They don't offer another answer or a better life or hope.  All I can see that they are here for is to try to take hope away from believers.  My faith is strong enough not to be swayed by evil outside forces with nothing to offer.\n\nI am here in this forum to answer questions to the best of my ability in the hopes of giving wisdom to the seeker and hopefully save a soul or two.  There have also been times when a question or link has touched my soul and blessed me as well.\n\nThis isn't a battle of wills at all my friend.  This is a spiritual battle.  The bad news for the unbelievers is that the battle has already been won through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  So even if an Atheist deems he/she won a battle here in the forum what has it gained them?  They've already lost the war.

__label__10 , How was the U.S.S.R involved in the Cold War?,,The U.S.S.R. was involved because they were the main enemy to the U.S. in the Cold War (1945- 1990). Understand that the U.S.S.R. helped the Allies out in WWII, and at the Yalta conference with Winston Churchill, and FDR, they all decided that the smaller countries such as Poland (invaded by Nazi Germany) and Czechoslovakia would decide how they wanted their government to be. The U.S.S.R didn't keep this promise, and these countries became communist.

What is the logic of playing the song to death before it's available in stores?,to ensure that the song is recognisable by the time that they release the cd. If they releases both at the same time, it would still take a bit of time for sales to pick up as people would  not be familiar with the songs.

Stay away from canned foods as much as possible. They pack way too much sodium. just eat as healthy and natural as possible and by doing that her cholesteral should go down. As long as she checks her blood suger level regularly too she should be fine there. Make sure that if you want desserts make them with splenda. Try to get no sugar added and sugar free things too. To reduce oils you want to bake, broil, or poach the food. (poaching is pretty much just boiling) If you use oils stick with the healthy natural ones. Well I hope that this info really helps you out. Good luck and your mom will be fine aslong as she lives a healthy lifestyle now.

__label__4 , gomti action plan?,,Under this component, pollution abatement works are being taken up along the Gomti river in Lucknow, Sultanpur and jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh, India. About 269 mld of sewage is targeted to be intercepted, diverted and treated under this action plan.\n\n\nOut of the project outlay of Rs. 58.11 crore, an amount of Rs. 7.21 crore has been released by the GoAP. Subsequent to the CCEA’s(Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs) approval in 1993, the Gomti Action Plan was posed to the UK Govt. for funding. \n\n     The UK Govt. agreed to fund pollution abatement works in lucknow town only, in two phases. The first phase comprising certain emergency works and the master plan preparation, was completed in March, 1999. However, the Govt. of UK delayed the decision for funding the main action programme (under the Second Phase of its project) and finnaly in August, 1997 refused to fund it.  \n\n     Thus, work under the major component of Gomti Action Plan (out of the total CCEA provision of Rs 58.11 crore for schemes implementation under GoAP, about Rs 50 crore is for Lucknow) could not be started even four years after the approval of the CCEA. Subsequently, the Govt. of UP submitted revised cost estimates for Rs. 237.40 crore, far in excess of the originally approved outlay. \n\n    The reason for UK govt's refusal to sanction the money is unkown. Hope this information is sufficient for your question.
__label__10 , ADMIN LAW question for LAW STUDENTS-LAWYERS-ATTORNEYS-JUDGES?,Under Chevron, you can't review an agency action if the legislature left the decision to the discretion of the agency.\n\nBut we have these six grounds for overturning agency action, like when they don't follow procedure or acted unlawfully.  How can you ever challenge and overturn on those six grounds if you can't even challenge the action?,I am not sure where did you get an idea that you cannot challenge the action under Chevron. \nChevron approach – to resolving by court if the construction is legal is roughly this:\n1. Ask: Did congress directly speak to the issue? if the congress has answered – keep the agencies to that.\n2.If congress did not speak:\n      a. Check if the Agency has reasonably resolved the precise issue? If the agency's interpretation is unreasonable, or impermissible -- based on other congressional intent or on Constitution -- remand it back to the agency so that the agency can change it.\n      b. If the congress has explicitly delegated the policy to the agency,  the agency is allowed any policy as long AS it reasonably serves the purpose of the statute, But it can still be stricken down if it is  arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the statute.\n\nSo nowhere i the chevron does it say that you CAN'T challenge agency action

__label__3 , i have anxiety and depression, are there other options then prescribed meds?,I have been dealing with Anxiety and Depression for a few years now, i was 17 when signs and symptoms occured, 19 when i got put on meds in 2003. I am now 22, and want to know if there are other options that work just as well as prescribed meds, so, that MAYBE i can talk to my doctor about them.\n\nYes, i have been on meds since 2003. I've had doctors tell me i'm on too many, and doctors who say If they're working, don't stop. But, last week, i was in for a panic attack again, and one of them said my body's becoming immune to them, meaning that soon, they won't work anymore.\n\nSo, are there other options? What are they? And maybe where can i get more info.,Yes, there are absolutely other options than prescribed medication. I myself have grown up with depression and anxiety. For a number of years my doctor had me on all types of anti depressant medication. Though medication can help there are many other options available. If you wanted to go a different route, there are natural supplements which you can buy at most healthfood stores or even online. I have found they can work just as well if not better than prescribed antidepressants. Supplement you should look into are things like St. Johns wart, 5-HTP, SAM-e and believe it or not Omega-3 fatty acids can also really help.  I take 5-HTP instead of prozac which is what I was on and I believe it works just as well, if not better.\nI have also recently come across a product called mind soothe which looks to be very promising http://www.nativeremedies.com/mindsoothe_for_depression.shtml\n\nAs well as taking suppliments..because in reality there is no miricle pill...you might want to try yoga...it can really help\n\nBefore you make any decisions you should talk to your doctor. I hope I was of some help :)

(The equivalent in higher plants are meristematic cells.) Stem cells have the potential to act as a repair system for the body, because they can divide and differentiate, replenishing other cells as long as the host organism is alive.\n\nFor more information about stem cell, u should visit:\nhttp://stemcells.nih.gov/

It is better than Rome for shopping although Rome is more historic and picturesque, but if you wanted beauty you you choos Florence over Rome. I know as I've seen all 3.\n\nI live in London but despite loving it would say it's too expensive for Americans due to the sterling:dollar exchange rate. Been to Paris 5 times - great to buy food but it's just overpriced for fashion as the French spend the highest proportion of their income on clothes in the world!\n\nDon't believe Copenhagen! Whilst Denmark is the most exciting of the scandanavian countries it is very socialist so has high taxes on goods; especially food and alcohol to discourage obesity and alcohol related health problems.\n \nMadrid, Spain is ok but they don't offer the best quality (like milan) or the best prices. \n\nIf you want cheap but cheerful you could try the new EU ascension countries like Czech Republic (Love Prague, those Czech women could look gorgeous in potato sacks) and Poland are great.\n\nHappy shopping and bon voyage!

__label__4 , adhd, add, or learning problems what do you think that school should do?,well this is a tough subject because there are people that feal drugs are the key and I for one am agenst the drug use,\nbut the qeustion is how to help parents teachers/schools help kids with special needs like reading writeing ect. cause there arent enouph people helping out. the teachers just throw us in the back of the class and say try to keep up if not then to bad. emagin one special eds teacher for 6 kids imposible one is in 7 and the rest are in higher grades. and the other question is why arent the schools doing any thing about it?\nyes I am one of the less helped when I was in school I have ADHD and a couple of learning disabilitys. and I gues I just hate siting back while other kids that need help get treated like dirt and are forced to think of it as well there is always manual labor.\nand I would like to hear others answers to these big problems. is drugs the key to study or is it finding that one thing that makes them happy and try to help them learn?,In my opinion, do what you have to do to adapt. \n\nPlenty of people in years past got through and did so without excuses. I have ADHD, and a craptastic memory. But I have relied on compensatory devices, mnemonics, tape recorders, associations (e.g. neighbor named savannah, I think of girl-scout cookies), etc.\n\nSo I use technology, ranging from my PDA to the old fashioned notebook to keep up with everything. I have a heavy load atm in the nursing program...8-10 chapters every couple of weeks, with skills labs, care plans, hospital rotations, yada yada yada. \n\nAnd hey, I've always had to go through information two the three times longer than your average student but I'm keeping up with this very heavy courseload. \n\nThing is, you just have to adapt to the situation and get your responsibilities taken care of. Few people in life have everything laid out for them, the rest of us have to keep up and work on our weaknesses where we can.\n\nFailure is the price of laziness, and not being prepared. \n\nToo many people want to look for an excuse to explain away their shortcomings. Or better yet, want to cast blame. But like ya said, the teachers can only do so much. Problem is that this society has begun to frown on recognizing greatness, frowns on the use of red pens because they are too negative, frowns on creating standards that separate the hard working from those who don't add up.\n\nThen the problem is exacerbated when you consider there are so many parents out there that have no damn business being parents. Or the politicians more concerned with garnering votes that keeping the bar raised to an internationally competitive level.\n\nHell I could go on and on. Basically, it's the fault of the republicans, the democrats, the parents, the kids, the teachers, society in general, the pharmacological ass-kissers, my dog sam, and a bunch of other pricks I'm probably not even thinking about atm. \n\nI really could go on and on all day...but basically the moral of this is that the school should do nothing. The schools are there just to provide a foundation. It is the responsibility of society as a whole to make sure that students are prepared, that they have the resources available to them, and that everyone doesn't come out a freaking moron who isn't prepared for life.\n\nThe main problem with medications is that they only treat the symptoms, not the underlying problems. In many cases this is the only option, but hey consider all the kids you know on ADD drugs...hyperactive, failure to concentrate, poor social skills...that is EVERY child I have EVER freaking known! Where I come from, that's normal. \n\nBut get some jerk doctor in the new health care system where patients magically become customers (crock of $#!* if you ask me) , who will quickly throw a prozac, ritilin, etc. at a patient just to make them feel like they've done something...and the problem is exacerbated. \n\nMeanwhile those who are trully suffering and could benifit from a more disciplined approach falter as pills are thrown at them. \n\nWith all of this having been said, i'll take psychologists and their drugs over tom cruise and the scientology group any day. \n\nWow want a whiney rant, sorry if that doesn't answer your question and hey, hopefully it helped anyway.

__label__3 , Weight Loss?,Hi I am 20 something petite women that stand at 140 and I need help right now!\nI’m   40-35-40 I feel that it is to much for woman that is short like me I just had my last child and all this pop up.  With my other 2 baby my weight was the same 120-125 but the breast was still big I feel like a cow but my husband say it ok(maybe he will not tell me ) but i know that  I’m fat. I need help with an effect way to loss weight mainly in the stomach and breast . The hip and thigh just need to be tone (I guess )my dream body would be 36© 26- 36 at 115-120 what can I do help this matter. Question   does any body think the weight loss tea would work in this matter,I am 5'4 145 pounds and a 55 year old grandmother. I have no idea what my measurements are. I haven't taken them in decades! I know as one gets older one's butt tends to disappear and flatten out. My point is, as we have kids and age, our bodies change. That does not mean you can't change some of it, but be realisitc with your ideal.\n\nThere is one basic principle for weight loss-burn more calories than you eat. Exercise burns calories and shapes the muscles, so that is a good thing.\n\nHere are some basic tips for reducing calories.\n\nRead food labels. \nLook for foods that are low in fat, low in calories, high in fiber.\nAvoid most processed foods. \nPIck low fat or non-fat alternatives.\nStay away from ALL fast food. One normal fast food meal has all the fat and calories you need for an ENTIRE DAY. This goes for fried chicken and fish, pizza, hamburgers, etc.\nPlan your meals the day before so you have healthy choices.\nEat more fruit and vegetables, at least 5 servings a day, more is better.\nAvoid all things with white flour and white sugar in them.\nSoups that have lots of veggetables in broth are good. Creamed soups are not. \nNo chips, unless they are baked. Pay attention to the serving amounts on the package. \nGo easy on rice,.pasta and bread. 1/2 cup (measure it) is a serving for rice and pasta!!!\n\nGood luck! I have found that Weight Watchers works for me.

I feel like my time is running out and I feel sooo helpless. Please help me!!!,first you got to calm down,panic wont get your hair back.OK?\nthen you got to start some positive thinking.first you got to go see a doctor who will advise you on what you can do and if you got to do some tests to make sure you're not sick.loss of hair can come from a variety of reasons besides genetics.then when you had done all this and if there's still no solution,just then you must begin thinking about coping with it and turning it to your advantage.there are many successful and sexy bald men .\nlast but not least,if french they say calvicie precoce erection feroce!which means early bald head makes ferocious erections.OK?so cheer up.;)

__label__2 , 2nd request, any ideas/help?,A 588 N uniform boom (L = 24 m) is supported by a cable and is at an angle of 48 deg above the horizontal. The boom is pivoted at the bottom and a 1770 N object hangs from its end.  A support cable is attached (at a 90deg angle) to the boom at a distance of 0.66 L from the foot of the boom and its tension is perpendicular to the boom. \n\nA) find the tension T in the support cable in units N.\n\nB) find the horizontal component of the reaction force on the boom by the floor in units N.\n\nC) find the vertical components of the reaction force on the boom by the floor in units N.,The beam is at 48 degrees to the horizontal.. Its weight of 588N acts at its middle (0.5L) vertically downwards. There is a load of 1770N at its end (1L). The tension due to the cable acts perpendicular to the beam and at a distance of 0.66L. Now, the basic equation in physics tells that the clockwise moment is balanced by the counter-clockwise moment in a stationary object. So, if 'T' is the tension in the cable;\n\nT*0.66L = 588*0.5L*cos48 + 1770*1L*cos48\n\nsolve this to get the answer to A).\n\nThe answer to B) is got by equating the horizontal forces to zero as the beam is stationary. The equation is:\n\nHR - T*cos(90-48) = 0.\n\nhere HR is the horizontal component of the reaction force by the floor. T is as above\n\nC) The vertical component is got by equating the vertical forces to zero.\n\nVR - 588 - 1770 + T*sin(90-48) = 0

__label__3 , Piercing a c l i t does this give you more pleasure or dull it?,Girls in por ns don' tmess with it so much.  Rumor has it you can have an org asm walking down the street .  that sounds cool,I would have to say that it depends on your clit. There are those that can take the roughness of it, and there are those that are pretty delicate. I knew a girl once who thought that having her clit done would highten her orgasm when she fucked, but ended up taking it out because it pulled on her skin to roughly. it depends........And if you're thinking about getting one, i would take into consideration that the safest way to keep it when you first get it, is to take a shower after everytime that you pee. Everytime you pee, the grossness in your urine gets in the peircing, which raises your risk for infection. And think, who wants to see a fucked up puss-infested clit? Gross huh?

__label__3 , How many calories do I eat if I want to loose 20 pounds?,I really want to know and does it matter if I eat calories from fat. Also do I eat food that has total fat, saturated fat, or transfat even though it might contain a small number of calories.,Ideally you want to take your body weight times 12 or 13 to get the number of daily calories for weight loss.  So for example if you weigh 150 you would need to eat 1800 calories a day (150 x 12).  You can divide this over 5-6 meals a day so you would have 300 calories for each of your 6 meals.  Eating smaller meals every 2 to 2.5 hours will help in keeping you feeling full throughout the day and you should be drinking plenty of water as well.  These meals should consist of protein, healthy carbs, and healthy fats (olive oil, avocado, small amount of nuts), these are monosaturated, and healthy fats, which aid in weight loss.  Cut out saturated and trans fat.  Cut out all processed and fast food and alot of sugar and white bread, and rice, etc.  This will get you on track to lose 1-2 lbs a week, if you're losing more than that add more calories, if you're losing less than 1lb a week, slowly cut the calories a bit ; like 250-300 per day.  Good luck

__label__10 , This is for smokers in Ohio?,Does anyone that lives in Ohio think that its fair that us smokers have to give up smoking in public places because of people that cant be around smoke?,I live in Ohio and I'm a smoker.  I believe that in certain cases it is fine to not allow smoking, like in office buildings and court houses and the like.  I also believe that the owner of the property should be able to decide whether or not he wants to allow smoking.  As in privately owned restaurants and bars.  These places may be public in the sense that anyone off the street can go in there and sit down and have a meal/drink.  However, its like listening to bad music, if you don't like it, don't listen.  If you don't like that people are smoking in a certain restaurant, don't go there.  It's called choice and the fact that some people don't smoke or don't want to be around smoke shouldn't limit the number of places smokers can go and enjoy a meal or drink and be able to have a cigarette when finished.  Also, it is ridiculous to make people stay fifty feet or whatever from the entrance to a building.  Outside there are many other carcinogens in the air besides smoke that people breathe in every minute of every day.  Not to mention that being outside in itself takes away the second-hand smoke factor.

Sometimes I just wish that I could be with her. I couldn't stop thinking about her. How can I tell if she's interested? Help!,Consider whether or not your feelings are just a crush..or are deeper. If they are deeper, than you should find other employment. It is really never good to become involved with one's boss. Only then I would recommend asking her if she is interested in more with you.
__label__2 , y is it wen you say a word over and over it eventually loses its meaning...?,,Applies to other senses as well. If you stare at a picture for long enough it also tends to lose it's meaning. Everything only has meaning when it is put into context with something else, how it interacts with other objects. Take an object out of it's normal context, isolate it and it loses something. Take that same object and place it with objects that it would normally never be seen with and it takes on a whole new meaning, this was the idea of the art movement of Surrealism and a mechanism for exploring the technique of lateral thinking. When a word is repeated over and over it loses it's meaning because the brain kind of 'loses interest' in it's normal activity of associating the word with other words and meanings leaving it with nothing but the literal input of the sound of the word itself.

Signs up at both entrance and exit and/or no parking signs posted. \n\nB. Painted yellow or red curbs. ( yellow no parking,red fire lane )\n\nIf there is no signs and/or painted curbs. Fight it in court. Take pictures of the area and show the judge and/or hearing officer  the pictures and request a court date. The issuing officer  MUST  appear in court  or the ticket must be dismissed due to you have the right to confront and defend yourself and ask them how can they enforce a no parking zone w/ no signs or painted curbs. If you fight it most judges or hearing officers w/ drop the ticket.

__label__3 , What are the side effects of 1.-ripped fuel (or any fat burning pill)and 2. Buying protein powder?,I am on my second month of weight lifting and there are so many products on the market! Is the protein poweder only for men? Should I buy whey or soy protein, And When I should use it? How about fat burning caffeine loaded pills? Should I or shouldn't I use them? What about creatine?,1. Fat burning pills\nMost of them contain random herbs, caffeine, and green tea. With the exception of ephedra, common side effects would be jitters (from caffeine), alertness / insomnia, decreased appetite, and possible increased heart rate. With ephedra-based, every one of those side effects would be enhanced. I take them not for weight loss but to stay awake in the morning. Studies are mixed as to whether they actually promote weight loss. I would be cautious about exercising while taking any pill containing ephedra, especially high intensity. \n\n2. Protein\nHow intense are your weight workouts? Are you getting enough protein in your diet? 1.6g of protein per kg of bodyweight is enough, so unless you're not eating right or are training intensely I wouldn't worry about protein powder. Whey is a fast acting protein and is typically taken directly after a workout to get protein to muscle quickly. Cassein (sp) is a slower protein that would be taken during the day. I wouldn't buy soy protein unless it's already part of your diet. Protein powders can be used by anyone. Women should only avoid the hormones and prohormones on the market.\n\n3. Creatine\nCreatine won't hurt you, but unless you care about larger muscles / increased strength it's not important. Most people (that are not vegans) get enough creatine through diet ie. meat. Beware that some people are non-responders, which means consuming creatine has no effect as their muscles have enough of it. Responders see an increase in muscle size and in some cases muscle strength. There are hundreds of studies of creatine and results vary.\n\nJohn

__label__1 , What is A Course in Miracles?,,A Course In Miracles is an answer to one woman's willingness to see.  She was an atheist with a Baptist background, working in a big medical center in New York City.  She and her boss had a prickly working relationship, until they both decided at about the same time that there must be a better way.  Once this was stated, the woman heard a voice say: This is a course in miracles.  Please take notes.  \n\nSeven years later, after taking all the material down as dictated to her by the voice, A Course In Miracles was finished.  Because of her baptist background, (my opinion), the Course, along with the text, and the Workbook For Students, and The Manual For Teachers, is in a rather Christian sounding style, that I at first was uncomfortable with...until I began to practice what it teaches.  It works.  My study of this magnificent material over the last fifteen or so years, has transformed my life, and the lives of millions of other people.

__label__4 , senior paper on conformity in fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.  Help?,,I would guess you are asking how the book shows conformity. To that I would have to point out that in the book there is little to no reading material. The people only see art through their television which is run by the government. Without seeing any creativity through either written form or other artistic outlets, a person would not have any thoughts against their given reality. \n\nThe book runs along the same lines as the movie 1984 which also has the theme of destroying all manner of creativity and controlling the population through created and fabricated information. \n\nThe book does show though that even though people can be fed false information, eventualy (in the case of the main character) they will reject their created reality and will go off in search of the truth. Much the same happend in the movie 1984 and other similar big brother style movies and books. Even the popular movie The Matrix has similar ties in that people are forced into a fabricated reality and over time many come to believe something is wrong with their existance and question what is real and what is not.

__label__1 , Do Christians think we should all become mindless Jesus worshipping drones?,,First of all Christians aren't mindless. God doesn't want us to be mindless nor does he want us to have blind faith. He wants us to use our brain and think and question things and make decisions for ourselves. That is why he gave us brains and free will. God wants us to know what we believe and why and as such we must have our eyes wide open in our faith in Him. I have never forced my beliefs on anyone. Jesus has never done that either. He would give His opinion and have His say. Anyone forcing their religion or beliefs on someone is in the wrong. Even a Christian who tries to force their opinion on someone is sinning and needs to stop. Yes I will give my opinion on lots of things, especially when I see someone such as you making the comments or posing a question such as you have, but you are free to believe and think what you want. Yet it seems that most of those who are Anti-Christ and Anti-God want to have their say or make rude comments, but not let the Christians have their say. So now you had your say and I had mine and you can take it or leave it. The choice is now yours. John 3:3-6 and Ephesians 2:8-9

As a starter, sqrt(4x^2) = 2x, and sqrt(9) = 3. \n\n3) x^2 + 8x + 16\nNow for something completely different. The following is a true statement.\n(Ax + B)(Cx + D) = (AC)x^2 + (BC)x + (DA)x + (BD)\nSo, if this will factor, you need to find A, B, C, and D so that AC = 1, BD = 16, and BC+DA = 8. [The last one is true because of the distributive property of multiplication, in other words xz + yz = (x+y)z ] \nThe first assumption we are going to make is that because AC = 1; A = 1 and C = 1. This won't always be true, and if we can't find something to match the others, we can always go back and change that assumption. We do this because it's the easiest to work with. Since A=1 and C=1, then we can rewrite BC + DA = 8 as B+D=8.\nNow, go back to when you learned to multiply signed numbers. The only way you can have a positive number as a product is when both multipliers are the same sign. Now, go back farther to adding signed numbers and remember that a negative plus a negative is always going to be a negative. Since BD is positive and B+D is positive, then both B and D are positive. In fact, the only two numbers that fulfill both statements are B=4, D=4 (If that jump's too great for you, factor 16 and you get 2*2*2*2. That means your choices for pairs are 2,8 (adds to 10, so wrong); 1,16 (17); and 4,4 (8).)\nSo, when we plug our numbers back into that statement a few dozen lines ago, we get the factoring of \n(x+4)*(x+4), or (x+4)^2\n\n4) 4(x^2) + 4x + 1\nOK, this is the same deal. (ax+b)(cx+d)=ac(x^2)+adx+bcx+bd\nSo, bd=1, ad+bc=4, and ac=4\nSince we have another product of 1; assume, for a minute, that b=1, d=1. That means a+c=4 and ac=4. Again, both product and sum are positive, so both a and c are positive. Factor 4, and you get 2*2. So your choices are 1,4 (sum of 5); and 2,2 (4). So, plug back in and you get\n(2x+1)(2x+1) or (2x+1)^2\n\n5) 2d^2 - 18.\nThis one is a tricky one. You can't do the difference of squares, because sqrt(2) and sqrt(18) are both irrational. But there is something you can factor out....\nRight, factor out a two and you have\n(2)(d^2-9) or (2)(d^2 - 3^2)\nNow, you have a difference of squares, and can easily get the answer.\n(2)(d+3)(d-3)

Dont pop really hard, you want control not height. Oh yeah and stay centered... thats really important. Honestly i cant say that i have to just in a certain direction to catch them though... they usually flip under me like a kickflip. so i guess its all about how you pop it for that. work on those shove its. they are important.

__label__10 , Case management conference?,I recently had a case management conference,for a personal injury lawsuit.What are the chances of me receiving a settlement instead of taking this to trial? Also, is my lawyer required to notify me if they have made any offers to settle?,Neither the insurance company nor your attorney want this thing to go to trial.  It is costly and most often times cheaper for the insurance company just to pay you to go away.  Chances are very great that if you present them with a reasonable demand, they will meet you with a reasonable offer.  If you are unreasonable, you will end up in trial.  \n\nAnd yes, your attorney has to make every offer to settle known to you.\n\n[edit]  Also remember, probably part of your agreement states that you will be responsible for reimbursing your attorney for expense incurred.  These can kill your settlement offer.  Things like postage, copying, deposition expenses, expert expenses, all are very very costly.

__label__2 , thank you for quick response,however im still at aloss.how do the atoms in a pencil for exampleknow,know that it is part of the eraser and not the metal fastner or the wood or the black ink in the name stamped inthe side?if they are constantly in motion why doesnt the pencil not begin to blur and dissisipate?,.  The atoms in the pencil are in motion, but not freely in motion.  The atoms are bound up in molecules which make up crystaline or cellular structures.  The metal atoms in the eraser holder are part of the metal crystaline matrix.  The carbon and other atoms of the eraser are parts of organic molecules which form strands which are interlinked.  The carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms of the wood are parts of cellulose molucules which formed the cell wall of the tree from which the wood was taken.  The lead of the pencil contains carbon molecules in fractured crystals of graphite, which are mixed with clay, which contains silicon, aluminum and oxygen in a crystaline structure.\n.  If you picture a ping pong ball tethered by a weak rubber band and knocked around by a mild shifting breeze, the ping pong ball would be free to move, but the rubber band would keep it moving about the same center.  A stronger breeze might have enough energy to break the rubber band and let the ping pong ball be blown wherever the wind goes.\n.  Atoms are of just the size that puts them on the brink of quantum mechanical uncertainty.  They are large enough that the uncertainty about their position is very small, even when their energy is know to a high degree of precision.  In quantum mechanics, this means that the amount they will wander is quite small, small enough that they remain bound to their neighbors in their molecular or crystaline arrangements.  Adding energy in the form of heat both increases the uncertainty about their position and increases the probability that their bonds will be broken.

The Committee is also\nconcerned by allegations that those detained in such facilities could be held for prolonged periods\nand face torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The Committee considers the “no\ncomment” policy of the State party regarding the existence of such secret detention facilities, as well\nas on its intelligence activities, to be regrettable. (articles 2 and 16)\nThe State party should ensure that no one is detained in any secret detention facility\nunder its de facto effective control. Detaining persons in such conditions constitutes, per\nse, a violation of the Convention.,This is the slippery slope. How do we demand that other countries do not torture our soldiers, if we have no problem torturing theirs?\nThis was the basis for the Geneva Convention. Everything is fair game during the battle, but, if captured, you were effectively taken out of the war, and as such, would then be treated in a more humane manner.\nA principle, that I think, a lot of countries strived to maintain as best they could. Was every prisoner treated humanely?  Of course not. Any time you throw humans into the mix, you aren't going to have perfection...no matter how noble the idea.\nBut to have a government itself support the concept of torture, invites other countries to do the same. Is this really what we want for our soldiers?\nAnyhow, I don't think torture is a very effective tool. Physical, anyhow. People can only withstand so much pain before saying anything just to make it stop. Including making things up. There are more effective tactics out there.

For the comic book character, see Stature (comics).\nHuman height, or stature, is the height of a human being. Adult height generally varies little between people compared to other anthropometric measures. Exceptional height (variation from the average of around 20%) is usually due to gigantism or dwarfism. Adult height for one sex in a particular ethnic group follows more or less a Gaussian distribution (bell curve) but with some individuals lying several standard deviations away from the mean. (The tallest well-documented giant was 8 foot 11.1 inches (2.72 m) tall.) Height is determined by the interaction of genes and environment. Final adult height may be attained anywhere from the early teens to early 20s, though it is most commonly reached during the mid teens for females and late teens for males. A person's height also varies over the course of the day, by an average of 19 mm (¾ in), gradually shrinking as the spine compresses over the course of a day, and stretching back out overnight (Tyrrell, et al. 1985).[1]\n\n \nYao Ming is the tallest person in the NBAContents [hide]\n1 Changes in human height \n2 Determinants of growth and height \n3 Process of growth \n4 Height abnormalities \n5 Role of an individual's height \n6 The role of height in sports \n7 Average adult height around the world \n8 References \n8.1 Notes \n9 See also \n10 External links \n \n\n\n[edit] Changes in human height\nThis article or section may contain original research or unverified claims.\nPlease help Wikipedia by adding references. See the talk page for details.\nHuman height is regulated by many factors. Since the development of modern medicine and plentiful nutrient-rich food in the developed world average height has increased dramatically. Nutrition is the most important factor in determining height; and height records from military records and other documents can be used to quite accurately compare nutrition and height in various eras. Evidence has shown that height decreased in Britain in the early nineteenth century, before beginning its long increase around mid-century. Increase in height has not been constant, however. The European Middle Ages was an era of tallness with men of above six feet (1.83 m) considered unremarkable. In Europe human height reached its nadir at the start of the nineteenth century. Until the general rise in human health, as urbanization increased, the accompanying trend was a height decline.\n\nEuropeans in North America were far taller than those in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, in fact the tallest in the world. The original indigenous population was also among the tallest populations of the world at the time. However, several nations, indeed many nations in Europe, have now surpassed the US in terms of average stature, particularly the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian nations. Most markedly is the Netherlands where average height has increased at the greatest rates. For instance: the Netherlands was in the late nineteenth century a land renowned for its short population, but today it has the tallest average in the world [1], with young men averaging 1.83 m (6 ft) tall and only shorter than the peoples of the Dinaric Alps, where males average 1.856 m(6ft 1.08 in) tall. The Dutch are now well known in Europe for extreme tallness. The increase has been so dramatic that various things have been redesigned to fit the much taller frames. In contrast, average male height in impoverished Vietnam and North Korea[2] remains comparatively small at 5 ft 4 in (1.63 m) and 5 ft 5 in (1.65 m) respectively. Currently, young North Korean males are actually significantly shorter. This contrasts greatly with the extreme growth occurring in surrounding Asian populations with correlated increasing standards of living. Young South Koreans are about 3 i

She tried to kill me (tried to strangle me in my bed) because she thought my dad would come back if she killed me and my 2 sisters. It was downhill from there until I was 18 and moved out. It was total survival for me and my sisters until we came of age, and we just survived for each other.

All the ghosts were contained in glass prisons, and were caught with the aid of the psychic Rafkin, who could locate them, and on the behalf of Cyrus.\n\n1. The First Born Son (played by Mikhael Speidel)\n\nThe First Born Son is the ghost of a little boy called Billy Michaels, who was obsessed with cowboy films. Not heeding his parents' advice, he played Cowboys and Indians with a real bow and arrow, and the arrow went straight through his forehead.\n\n2. The Torso (played by Daniel Wesley)\n\nThe Torso is the ghost of a gambler called Jimmy Gambino. Losing everything in a poker game, he tried to welch on his bet and escape. The mob, which he owed money to, caught up with Gambino and cut him into several pieces, wrapping them in cellophane and dumping the corpse.\n\n3. The Bound Woman (played by Laura Mennel)\n\nThe Bound Woman was a cheerleader, who was strangled after a high school prom after cheating on her boyfriend. She was strangled by him, and was later found buried on the football field.\n\n4. The Withered Lover (played by Kathryn Anderson)\n\nThe Withered Lover is Jean Kriticos, the wife of Arthur. She died in the freak house fire while trying to rescue her children.\n\n5. The Torn Prince (played by Craig Olejnik)\n\nThe Torn Prince is the ghost of Royce Clayton, who was a baseball star. He challenged a greaser to a drag race and was killed in the ensuing crash.\n\n6. The Angry Princess (played by Shawna Loyer)\n\nThe Angry Princess is Dana Newman, who constantly tried achieving perfection with her looks, despite being beautiful. She gave up eventually and slit her own wrists. She was found with dozens of self-inflicted gashes on her. The movie suggests that she killed herself for another reason (In the scene when she appears in the bathroom, you see the phrase I'm sorry on the floor in blood). This, however, was probably there to add more drama to the scene and not true.\n\n7. The Pilgrimess (played by Xantha Radley)\n\nThe Pilgrimess is the ghost of Isabella Smith, an English woman who travelled across the Atlantic and settled in New England. She was a separatist, and this isolated her from the other townsfolk. She was found guilty of witchcraft, and put to death in the stocks (pillory).\n\n8. & 9. The Great Child and The Dire Mother (played by C. Ernst Harth and Laurie Soper)\n\nThe Dire Mother is the ghost of Margaret Shelburne, who was imprisoned by a group of lumberjacks, forced to live in a cage as a form of entertainment, due to her being only three feet tall. She had a child with one of the lumberjacks, a son Harold who weighed over 300 pounds (136 kg).\n\nHarold was spoiled by his mother, who raised him to be her protector and to exact revenge on the lumberjacks. Harold took up his father's axe, and was capable of chopping down massive redwoods single-handedly. Eventually he turned the axe on the other lumberjacks, and both he and his mother were killed by a frenzied mob.\n\n10. The Hammer (played by Herbert Duncanson)\n\nThe Hammer is the ghost of a blacksmith, George Markley, who lived in a small town in the 1890s. He was driven out of town after wrongfully being accused of stealing. Enraged, he tracked down the people responsible and hammered them to death. The other townsfolk captured him, and they drove large nails into his body and cut off his hands.\n\n11. The Jackal (played by Shane Wyler)\n\nThe Jackal is Ryan Kuhn, a psychotic mental patient with a penchant for attacking women. He was permanently in a straitjacket, and had a metal cage locked around his head. After years of this, he had grown deformed, and reviled human contact. He was the only victim of a fire that broke out in the asylum; he apparently ran into the flames rather than let anyone touch him.\n\n12. The Juggernaut (playe

__label__3 , How can I prevent my Asthma from acting up so frequently while still on my regular medication?,The question is sort of self-explanitory,Hi Sentaka\n\nHere are some ideas on how to heal your condition.\n\nCause: \nAsthma is caused by malnutrition. Only by diligent and consistent effort to change embedded habits will one get permanent relief. The cough is a result of nature's effort to expectorate mucus from the lungs, after which breathing becomes easier. Ofttimes the cause of asthma is basically a nervous condition because the nerves are irritated \n\nHerbal Aids: \n1. Convulsions: When a person is in a convulsion there are certain herbs that will give very fast relief. One of these is tincture of lobelia, and a valerian decoction with a little cayenne added to relieve spasms. If such an attack comes after a meal one should use an emetic, such as a large dose of lobelia or use the Yoga finger method. (see # 2 below) \n\n2. Yoga Finger Method: Drink several cups of warm water, then place the middle finger deep down the throat and press the tongue until regurgitation starts. Mustard is also good to clean the stomach and lungs. Prior to the emetic a peppermint or spearmint tea should be used to soothe the area and alleviate the discomfort of continual vomiting. Hot fomentation of castor oil, comfrey, lobelia, mullein, etc., may be placed over the stomach, liver, spleen and lung areas. Frequent hydrotherapy baths or lengthy sweat baths are beneficial, followed by a cold shower or sponging. \n\n3. Vapor Bath: Another helpful method is to take a vapor bath twice a week, inhaling steam from a decoction of cudweed ragwort, wormwood, or a decoction of the following herbs, taken warm, (equal parts) will prove very beneficial: elecampane root, horehounds, hyssop, skunk cabbage root, vervain, wild cherry bark (and to this preparation add tincture of lobelia or antispasmodic tincture. Clear the bowels with an injection of catnip or barberry bark. This affliction also calls for plenty of outdoor exercise, deep breathing, and good ventilation while sleeping. The whole body system should be built up with tonic herbs such as chickweed, comfrey, marshmallow, mullein, etc. Diet should be mostly fruits and vegetables, avoiding all processed devitalized foods. \n\n4. Dr. Christopher's Herbal Respiratory Formula: (Resp-Free) It is wonderful for asthma. This combination of herbs in tablet, tea and capsule form is an aid to relieve irritation in the respiratory tract--lungs and bronchial. This is an aid in Emphysema as well as other bronchial and lung congestion such as bronchitis, asthma, tuberculosis, etc. Suggested amount for an adult is a cup two or three times a day, or 2 or 3 capsules or tablets two or three times a day with a cup of comfrey tea. For additional help in the program, it is good to add three to six drops of tincture of lobelia to each cup of tea. This formula consists of comfrey root, mullein, chickweed, marshmallow root and lobelia. \n\n5. Dr. Christopher's Hay Fever Formula: (Sha Tea) It is good for asthma also. This combination is a natural herbal aid working as a decongestant and antihistamine to dry up sinuses and expel from the head and broncho pulmonary tubes and passages the offending stoppage and mucus. Combine this with the respiratory combination to speed up the process. The wise person will turn to fresh wholesome food and beverages to keep the body in a perfect state. This will guarantee permanent relief, by going to the cause. \n\n6. Elder: The inner bark is used, although it should be aged before used. The fresh bark is violently irritating and poisonous to children. It is specifically used for spasmodic asthma with copious phlegm and stringy mucus. For asthma, take a tablespoonful whenever an attack threatens. Powdered Cloves can alleviate excessive vomiting when using the bark.

The American accents (even regional ones like Southern, New Yorker, Bostonian, and California) are very distinct, and with the widespread viewing of American films, no one from other countries seems to have any trouble picking an American accent out from the crowd.\n\nThey may have American accents down, but could a typical Australian tell the difference between a South Afrikaan, a Kiwi (aka New Zealander), an Irish, a British, a Scottish and a Welsh accent? ;-) Come on, Aussies!

There are about 50 billion of them. Instead scientist give them a catalogue name like NGC 1566 (New General Catalogue no. 1566 aka the Seyfert galaxy). Some galaxies were thought to have been nebulae or the remnants of stars. Charles Messier came up with a catalogue to organize them. Some, like M87, were not nebulae but galaxies and globular clusters. M87 is a gigantic elliptical galaxy that has a supermassive black hole, some 3 billion times more massive than the sun, in it´s center. So before M87 was discovered to be a galaxy it actually had a name. The romantic name M87.\n\nOur solarsystem is simply called Sol after our parent star.
__label__7 , How do you stop cussing?,I know cussings bad, but I cant release my anger with regular words. Simple words arent powerful enough. Like jerk. what kind of word is that? If someone said that to me I would just laugh. When I try and not cuss I cant think of any other words to replace those words. also when I try not to my mind wont let me. As in I'll be more pissed if I dont than when I do.,The best way to do this is by in every day conversation, try and not use these words.  I would imagine, you have to also determine what it is that sets you off, to where you get to the situation, where you use these words as well.  It's not going to happen tommorow.. or the next day, but as you search for other words to substitute the bad ones... it will become easier

Paranoia (space race could be them readying weapons) lead each country to ready massive retaliation strikes which prevented any offensive strikes.\n\n3.

Derivation  Meri means rebellion. Transliterated to Greek yields the name of Mary, the mother of Jesus. \n\nJones initially reads Their Rebellion. NOBSE reads Obstinacy, Stubbornness.\n\n(2) From  Mar and  Yam meaning sea. \n Mar means bitter;  Mar means myrrh. Both come from the root  Marar meaning be bitter, strengthen, strong.\n Mar probably means drop but is used only once, in Isa 40:15). \nJones (additionally) and Jerome read Stella Maris (star of the sea), but that strikes as a very free interpretation. \nThe name Miriam (Mary) means Bitternesses but also Strong Waters/ Waters Of Strength. \n\nClick here for more info:\nhttp://www.abarim-publications.com/Arie/Names/Miriam.html
__label__4 , Trigonometry: Apparent Size?????,Ok, can someone help me learn how to calculate this?\n\nThe diameter of the moon is about 3500 km. It's apparent sizeis about 0.0087 radians. About how far is it from Earth?,Picture a right triangle.  Moon's distance is the base, moon's diameter is the height.  Long base, small height.  Angle between base and hypotenuse is 00087 radians.  Height / base is tangent of that angle.  so tan(0.0087) = 3500 / distance.  rewrite as distance = 3500 / tan(0.0087) and solve with calculator.  answer should be in ballpark of 240,000 miles which is 384,000 km.

Any reason for that??,There are so many different reasons for it to be irregular. The biggest ones are not eating right and not getting enough nutrients, and also stress.

They also can be shallow and fall out of love with their spouse's physical appearance because they are full of their own desires and don't care about the other person's feelings at all.  \nA guy like this is not worth your time.  Find some things that you enjoy doing that make you happy and fill your heart with joy, so that you can get your mind off of him.  He's not worth your pain if he did this to you.

They aren't judgemental as some women can be and I don't have to put up with the jealousy that women seem to come across with, unless its their girlfriend or wife,lol. That is when I back off. No need in causing problems where it can be avoided. A trick to the friendship is to include the partner in the friendship where possible.

__label__1 , Should I ground my son for?,My son is 16 and very intelligent. He has scored in the top 5% of kids his age nationally on standardized testing. Yet he has a D for the fourth quarter in Geometry and holds a C for the year as of now. He also has A's in English, Chemistry, and a B in History. I have been telling him since half way through this marking period to pull up that grade and go for extra help. He doesn't always do his homework or study. He didn't go for any help even though the teacher offered. I told him at that time if he ended the quarter with a D he would be grounded for the first 3 weeks of summer.(working around the house, not going out) Even though he got good grades in his other classes and still will end the year with a C in geometry should he be grounded, if so for how long?,nah, don't ground him. i think it isn't even the case that he lacks doing his homework, or that he studies too less.\n\ni had the same problem in school, intelligent student, on every course i had high grades. only biology i could never get into my head. i doesn't interest me at all how flowers reproduce, my brain simply refused to keep that information.\n\nand i saw it a lot around me, intelligent people who are very good at a lot of things, always have a few things that they can't get their mind to do, no matter how much they even want to.\n\nin my country holland, we grade from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest. on almost all my classes i scored 8 or 9 or 10. Biology was always a 3 or even lower. No matter how hard i tried. \n\nAt the age of 16, i actually think it's a very good thing that your son chooses the things that obviously interest him the most. He's also old enough to realise that he won't really need geometry in the rest of his life. If he even increased his grades to a C, i think that's probably the maximum for something that obviously doesn't interest him at all. The smartest people are only lazy at things that they really have no affiliation with. \n\n(i'm sorry, i am aware of the fact that ur son will probably read this as well, and he will use it as an arguement against you trying to push him to study harder...but hey, then you shouldn't have asked me:P )\n Love and Sprite, Mark.

In a couple of years, when companies come calling for your batch guys, I am sure the packages they will offer will rival IIM packages.

So, forget about CAT. If you are interested in an MBA, do so after some years of experience. And join a finance/consults job right after IIT.

__label__9 , If men are scared of marriage, why are most divorces filed by women?,Most stats I've seen indicate that 70-75% of divorces are filed by women.\n\nI've also seen stats that put infidelity by men at about 60% and infidelity by women at about 40%, with women catching up to the infidelity rate of men.\n\nSo why do you think women, who typically complain than men are afraid of comittment, seem to want divorce two to three times more than do men?\n\nIt seems to me that men are more comitted to marriage than women.  Comments?,Actually, you're right. Women ARE more likely to leave a marriage than a man. I read somewhere, long time ago (when my mom left my dad), something that said that women's needs change during the course of a relationship, while men's needs primarily stayed the same (and yes, this does include the phyiscal needs). \n\nFor example, a woman who falls in love and marries a man because he has an exotic job may decide five years later that the job isn't enough because she now needs someone who can be at home at 5:15 every single night to help take care of the kids. Her needs changed; his didn't. She married him because she ALSO loved the job - not just him - and now she doesn't love the job any more, and so, by consequence, she no longer loves him. Irreconcilable differences, you know.\n\nMen, on the other hand, will fall in love and marry a woman who happens to HAVE an exotic job. If she then decides to stay home and have kids, he will often stay dedicated to her because he made that commitment and will stay the course. If he does stray - as you admit some men do - it's often because the woman's needs have changed... and half the time, she's straying, too!\n\nMen also have been taught by their fathers, over the generations, that women are to be cared for (which I agree with) no matter what. Even though women were liberated 30 years ago, men are still being taught this value, and apparently they're listening! Women have taken this liberation and used it to their advantage as a gender, allowing themselves the freedom of escaping from home responsibilities that men have shouldered for centuries.\n\nNow... that's my opinion.... anyone else?

We, family of him would like to recover it.. is it possible?...,, \n\n(guyz i mean his yahoo account..),First of all I'm sorry for your loss. If he had wanted to share this information with you he would have told you his ID. My family and I know each others ID and frequently watch each other get on this site. Remember him the way you knew him. You may be disappointed in some of the stuff he asked or answered here. Some of this stuff is so dirty and you would not want to remember him as visiting those questions to answer if he did. Not saying he did but you never know. Just love him for what you know of him and remember him with fondness. God bless you for the love you have for your brother.

__label__6 , SD Padres Dave Roberts?,I am thinking about getting him for my fantasy baseball team, due to his 14 stolen bases, but the main thing I aqm concerned about is he is up there is age, so my question is, since I prefer a long term solution, would it be wise to grab Roberts off the free agent list and hope for no injuries or would I be better off finding someone else? and if so, pls through out a couple of suggestions.\n\nThank you,Roberts is hot right now, so get him while he is still racking up steals. He's on pace for 66, but don't count on that. He's usually good for 30+, though, and I think that's what he'll end up with. Some better long-term solutions that might be available in your league are Felipe Lopez, Chone Figgins and maybe even Ryan Freel. Roberts is halfway to 30 steals already and may only give you 15 more while Figgins and Freel are around 10 steals and should finish with 30+. Lopez is leading the majors, so I doubt he'll be available in your league. But grab Roberts while he's still hot and when he starts to cool down, grab one of these other guys.

__label__4 , how does dopler radar work and what are some problems with it.?,,It was pretty clear from the fact that you have asked this twice that you did not get the answer that you were looking for so here is my try !!!\n\nThe First Answers on the other question were good, but doppler was made a little bit clearer when put to me like this.When applied to Sound Waves.  Have you heard a train horn coming toward you then away from you? The same horn at first sounds higher in frequency as the waves are compressing together in front of the train. Then as it passes, goes away the same horn sounds lower in frequency because now the waves are stretching out, reaching us at a lower rate per second this is the doppler effect.  I only say a train because it is the only vehicle that usually single=horned you can hear clearly like this.  A car passing if it blows it's horn will create the same effect and do the exact same thing. It's just not so noticeable.\n\nDoppler is how the Police catch you speeding! The early radar units were actually calibrated by the officers in the field using the back and forth motion of a common music tuning fork! (The back and forth motion of a certain note represented a certain specific MPH).\n\nDoppler really only refers to the change of frequency reflected from the target. If it is higher, then the target is coming toward the receiving antenna. If it is lower in frequency, the target is going away from the receiving antenna. The more the frequency shift, the faster the movement. \n\nConventional radar only shows the return signal, and does not measure its frequency shift from that which was transmitted.\n\nHope this helps you.\n\nThats basic Doppler 101\n\nThere is a Display (if it is a Weather type Radar) , a Transmitter / Receiver ,  Waveguide ( looks like square hollow copper tubing, conducts the radar signal ), Feed Horn (connects waveguide to antenna)  Parabolic Antenna ( Focus signal into Feed Horn)\n\nBy the wayI just remembered in the days of space travel and satelites.  When we tune in satelites the frequencies change as the satelite moves due to this doppler effect.  Now during re-entry when speeds are greater the shifts are noticeable.  And you can actually tell a difference from a ground station on the same frequency!\n\nOh yeah by the way no big problems with doppler,  except that some operator could aim the darn thing wrong I guess and single out the wrong vehicle for speeding.  Guess he would be cross eyed!!!  Mistakes happen in just about every thing that is done everywhere!  But doppler is very accurate people make mistakes.  Some few Police are true JERKS most are just humans doing their job and are actually well meaning people trying to save lives!!!!  If you feel you are unfairly stopped for speeding, now I mean you were really NOT speeding, calmly talk to the officer and just see what he can do for you.  Explain Just BE CALM the worst thing will be he will give you the ticket!  The best he will give you a warning!  DO NOT ARGUE WITH HIM! Be sympathetic!  It will work.  OR HE IS A JERK!\n\nI AM NOT A JERK, AND I HAVE CARRIED A BADGE!\n\nHey have a good day. Hope I have helped you in some way!!\n\nOH YEA ...  DRIVE CAREFUL HEAR \n\nAPS

__label__6 , Does anyone know where Jose (Chico) Lind is these days?,I'm not asking about his history the last 10 years - I know he went to prison for a year and had drug and alcohol problems.  I also know he managed the Bridgeport Bluefish for a few years, but he is no longer the manager.  I just wondered if anyone knew if he was coaching somewhere now or just taking time off.,This is his third season as manager, his seventh year since finishing a one-year jail sentence. He came to Bridgeport as a player, looking for a second chance. He had lost his wife and several years of his life -- he'd last appeared in the majors in 1995 with the California Angels -- but he discovered a team, and a league, desperate for players with recognizable names.\n\nWe had some concern about whether he would really work out for us, Bridgeport owner and founder Mickey Herbert said. But, from the time he came in here, he was a veteran. We were really surprised about how he chose to counsel the younger ballplayers, especially because, at first, he wasn't in any kind of coaching capacity.\n\nIn February 2003, manager Duffy Dyer left the team. He'd been offered a scouting job with the New York Mets. Suddenly, the Bluefish had Lind, and Lind had a chance he'd never really expected.\n\nMinor league baseball returns to Bridgeport for its eighth season; it’s been a smashing success as part of the city’s renaissance, which includes the arena opened next door.\n\nAn Atlantic League team (independent), the Bridgeport Bluefish play in the 5,300-seat stadium called Harbor Yard, which is a family-friendly, well-staffed and well-maintained operation. The park is between Main and Water streets, just south of I-95 and right near the train station and the ferry slip.\n\nThe Bluefish are managed by Jose “Chico” Lind, a former Golden Glove winner with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The park has a picnic area that groups of 24 to 250 may reserve and the games feature the kind of fan-friendly goings-on between innings that are so cherished in minor league baseball.\n\nGames will start at 7:05 Monday-Saturday, at 1:35 on Sunday. The season gets underway April 28 against Long Island and there will be fireworks every Friday and a host of special promotions including the popular Sundae Fun Day Run Day. The season continues through mid-September:-)

For your guidance the following is copied from the sources mentioned below.\n\nA call centre is a centralised office of a company that answers incoming telephone calls from customers. A call center may be an office that makes outgoing telephone calls to customers (telemarketing). \nCall centres are generally set up as large rooms, with work stations that include a computer, a telephone set (or headset) hooked into a large telecom switch and one or more supervisor stations. It may stand by itself or be linked with other centres. It may also be linked to a corporate data network, including main frames, microcomputer and LANs.

You have to understand that the Bible doesn't always refer to some things by name, but by reference. Just like there are many references to a place where souls go to be purified before entering Heaven, even though the actual word Purgatory is not mentioned. The Bible was not written originally in English, so we should not quibble over semantics to get to Truth. So it is with Guardian Angels. That particular English phrase is not spelled out but the references are numerous, and Imacatholic2 spelled them out clearly and beautifully. I am a Catholic, too. God bless you,

__label__2 , how do I build a steel galvanizing plant. Hot dipped Galvanization?,I would like to build  steel galvanization plant.,That's depending on what type of metal you want to cover the steel parts in the galvanization process. \n\nThe galvanization in words refers only to that kind of process which is using electric deposition of a metal through a bath of a electrolyte from a plate containing pure metal needing to be deposed on steel tide at the anode electrode or + polarity and at the other side (other electrode, cathode or - polarity).\n\nThere needs to be a certain recipe of mixed salts for creating very tight and uniform growth crystals, for not being corroded or leafed away with time. There are certain salts which provide this king of growing in the same time with the polished look of the piece galvanized. This salts can be dissolved in water,  for creating the electrolyte or being melt (which is not so safe technique) and used and kept like that. \n\nThe dipping is no so used any more and it can not be called galvanization. More recent techniques use hot plasma blowers, meaning a torch with plasma and a wire of the specific metal to be deposited being melt in the plasma and blown to the surface of the steel part.\n\nAnything you'll do you have to deal with the local Environmental Agencies and with the tap water supply/ sewerage administrator, because you;ll have to make a contract with them for you to show that you retain the hard metals from the water dropped to sewerage, if any.\nDfriend:)

__label__6 , historique du karaté?,,Origine\nll y a 1300 ans, Daruma (fondateur du Bouddhisme Zen en Inde), aurait introduit le Bouddhisme en Chine, y intégrant des méthodes d'enseignement spirituelles et physiques. Ces techniques étaient si éprouvantes que certains disciples tombaient d'épuisement ! \nPour leur donner plus de force et d'endurance, il développa une technique d'entraînement plus progressive. Il en fit un livre, Ekkin-Kyo, qui peut être considéré comme le premier livre de karaté.\n\nL'entraînement physique, fortement marqué par les principes philosophiques de Daruma, était enseigné au temple Shaolin en 500 avant J.C.\nEn résumé, le karaté d'Okinawa est la synthèse de 2 techniques de combat :\n- La première, utilisée par les habitants d'Okinawa était simple et terriblement efficace, et surtout très proche de la réalité car elle était utilisée depuis des siècles lors de véritables combats. \n- La seconde, beaucoup plus élaborée et imprégnée d'éléments philosophiques était le produit d'une ancienne culture chinoise. \nCette double origine explique la dualité du Karaté : très violent et efficace, mais en même temps une discipline stricte et austère marquée par une philosophie non violente. \n\nL'une des rares personnes à maîtriser toutes les méthodes du karaté d'Okinawa, Maître Funakoshi a enseigné une discipline complète, synthèse de tous les styles d'Okinawa. \nCette méthode fut connue sous le nom de Shotokan (Shotokan signifie Maison de Shoto, nom d'écrivain de Funakoshi qui fut aussi poète, ). De part la grande popularité de ce style au Japon, et plus tard dans le monde entier, Funakoshi est considéré comme le père du karaté shotokan moderne.\n\nNé en 1868, il a commencé à étudier le karaté à 11 ans et a été l'élève de deux grands maîtres de l'époque, Azato et Itosu. Il était si bon élève qu'on lui enseigna tous les styles de karaté d'Okinawa.\nPour lui, le mot karaté prit avec le temps une signification plus large et synthétisa toutes ces méthodes pour devenir le karaté-do, la voie du karaté, ou la main vide.\n\nEn 1916, il fit une démonstration au Botokuden de Kyoto (sur la principale île du Japon) qui était à l'époque le centre officiel de tous les arts martiaux. Le 6 mars 1921, le Prince héritier (qui deviendra Empereur du Japon), visita Okinawa et demanda à Funakoshi de lui faire une démonstration. \nEn 1922, il voyagea jusqu'à Tokyo pour présenter le karaté lors de la première exposition nationale sportive, organisée par le ministère de l'éducation.\nDevant le succès de sa méthode, on lui demanda de rester au Japon, et il ne retourna jamais à Okinawa.\nPar la suite, son fils, Yoshitaka introduira des exercices de combat et adaptera la pratique du karaté à la tradition japonaise. \nLe Karaté est aujourd'hui probablement l'art martial le plus populaire au monde.\nContrairement au Judo et à l'Aïkido, le Karaté ne fut jamais l'oeuvre d'un seul homme,\nmais celle de plusieurs générations de maîtres et de disciples,\nà travers une multitude d'écoles et de styles originaux qui conservent, aujourd'hui encore,\ntoutes leurs caractéristiques spécifiques.  \n \n Le karaté est un art qui cultive le courage et permet de développer la santé physique et mentale. De plus, grâce à l'entraînement de karaté, une personne peut se défendre contre une agression physique sans utiliser d'arme.\nToutefois, on peut également utiliser selon les circonstances certains outils ou instruments pour se défendre.\nLes gens voient souvent des techniques de casse de planches ou bris de tuiles avec le poing nu, et ceci fait qu'ils se méprennent sur le vrai but de l'entraînement de karaté. En fait ces techniques sont des techniques mineures.\nDe même que tout autre art martial, l'essence de l&#39

My bf now only hugs me and nothing more, but he was just telling me how long we'll be together. What should I do?,Just be frank to your boyfriend that you're not happy already with his company...but think many times if your best guy friend really cares for you or are you just pretending that he cares for you...?Your boyfriend seemed to respect you in any way he wanted because as what you said he just only hugs you and nothing more..\nI really don't know the whole story between you and your boyfriend. But maybe he's just asking you how long you could handle your relationship even if there are so many temptations around..Honey, if you're going to decide on what to do, just be careful to avoid regrets ok! Then think about it seventy times seven..
__label__7 , what is an assistance residential property manager duties?,,Every asst. manager job varies from property to property. It depends, mostly on the size of the property who does what. If it is a large property there is probably a leasing person to show apartments, answer phones, prepare lease files, do the filing and the correspondance. If the property is small that falls on the asst. manager to do.\n\nThe asst. manager covers for the manager, which is why they are called assistant managers. You screen calls, take care of the small problems that come in, handle walk in people,prepare newsletters and bulletins. Discuss decisions with the manager if they ask for input, make decisions when the manager is not available. You do basically whatever the manager asks you to do. Your job is to take the burden off the manager without acting like the manager. Or trying to take over the manager's job by second guessing the manager.\n\nThat's a very general description. Asst. managers are extremely difficult to find, good ones anyway. You are the most valuable person to the manager. Usually when the manager leaves, the asst. moves up to take the manager's position.

__label__5 , Can anyone expand PDA and tell about it?,,Personal digital assistants (also called PDAs or palmtops) are handheld devices that were originally designed as personal organizers, but became much more versatile over the years. A basic PDA usually includes date book, address book, task list, memo pad, clock, and calculator software. Many PDAs can now access the Internet via Wi-Fi, cellular or Wide-Area Networks (WANs) or Bluetooth technology. One major advantage of using PDAs is their ability to synchronize data with a PC or home computer.\n\nThe term personal digital assistant was coined on January 7, 1992 by John Sculley at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, referring to the Apple Newton. Earlier devices like the Psion and Sharp Wizard have the functionality to be considered PDAs, however. In fact, PDAs by other names were available as early as the mid-1970s -- first as very advanced calculators, then as electronic organizers, and later as palmtops. [1].\n\nPDAs are some times refered to as Palms or Palm Pilot after an early PDA created by Palm, Inc. This usage is a case of genericized trademark, similar to refering to a tissue as a Kleenex; or a bandage as a Band-Aid.\n\nThe currently major PDA operating systems are:\n\nPalm OS - owned by Palm, Inc. \nWindows Mobile (Pocket PC), (based on the Windows CE kernel) - owned by Microsoft \nBlackBerry - owned by Research In Motion \nMany operating systems based on the Linux kernel - free (not owned by any company) These include: \nGPE - Based on GTK+/X11 \nOPIE/Qtopia - based on Qt/E Qtopia is developed by Trolltech, OPIE is a fork of Qtopia developed by volunteers \nSymbian OS (formerly EPOC) owned by Ericsson, Panasonic, Nokia, Samsung, Siemens and Sony Ericsson \nMany PDAs run using a variation of the ARM architecture (usually denoted by the Intel XScale trademark). This encompasses a class of RISC microprocessors that are widely used in mobile devices and embedded systems, and its design was influenced strongly by a popular 1970s/1980s CPU, the MOS Technology 6502.\n\nAccording to a Gartner market study, the overall market for PDAs grew by 20.7% in the third quarter (Q3) of 2005, compared to Q3 2004, with marketshare resolving as follows (by operating system):\n\nPalm OS for Palm, Inc. PDAs and some other licensees- 14.9% (declining) \nWindows Mobile for PDAs that comply with the Microsoft's Pocket PC specifications - 49.2% (increasing) \nBlackBerry OS for BlackBerry PDA (produced by Research In Motion) - 25.0% (increasing) \nSymbian OS - 5.8% (increasing) \n\nPopular PDAs\n \nPalm IIIxe PDAPsion \nApple Computer Newton \nBlackBerry \nhp iPAQ Pocket PC (Originally Compaq iPAQ until HP merged in 2002) \nPalm Pilot, Tungsten, LifeDrive, Treo and Zire \nSharp Wizard and Zaurus \nSony CLIÉ \nTapwave Zodiac \nAlphaSmart Dana \nDell Axim \nGMate Yopy \nFujitsu Siemens Loox 720 \nList of PalmOS Devices \nAbacus_PDA_Watch \n\nVarious operating systems based on the Linux kernel for various special designed PDAs (many other supported) - 0.7% (stable) \nOther - 4.4% (stable) \nThe reason usually cited for the resumption in PDA market growth (after market declines in 2002 - 2004) is the growing interest in PDAs offering wireless email capabilities (such as BlackBerries), and PDAs with built-in GPS capabilities for navigation. Smartphones — mobile phones with PDA-like abilities will likely curtail PDA growth in the near future, as smartphones are becoming very popular.

Both selfishly cling to the idea of their love and will not consider 'loving' anything else. \nOh, and eventually, both get their heart broken by lies.,

The outer atmosphere of the Sun (which we can see during a solar eclipse) gets extremely hot again, up to 1.5 to 2 million degrees. At the center of big sunspots the temperature can be as low as 7300 °F (4300 K, 4000 °C). The temperature of the Sun is determined by measuring how much energy (both heat and light) it emits.\n\n\n\nlol davidroberts...hadn't heard that joke in a long time

__label__1 , Is it ok to believe in Wicca and A single God?,I've read in my book that the path of Wicca is one we choose ourselves. I've grown up learning about God, but not quite strickly. I read threw a fair few books about the Wicca Religion that stats you can choose your own path threw it. So in a way what I'm saying, is it ok to be Wicca, but alos follow the Traditions of God that I have been brought up with?,OK, firstly, a slight correction - Trampus, there's a slight error in the quote. Do what you will is the whole of the law is the creed of the Church of Satan, and puts no restraint on its members beyond their own self-interest. An it harm none, do what you will is the traditional Wiccan creed, which is a fairly different thing - Do what you will as long as you harm no-one. Taken together with the law of threefold return, that says whatever you put out into the world - harm or benefit - will come back to you three times stronger - it's an effecttive, pretty disciplined line to walk.\n\nNow, to the question: yes, you can follow your Wiccan path and believe in a single god, including the one you grew up with. There are Wiccans who dedicate themselves to single gods in various systems, from Norse and Celtic to Egyptian and Christian. The one defining characteristic of Wicca is its open-mindedness - if any path helps you to be a positive, respectful influence on the planet it's pretty much fine with most Wiccans. Blessed be, and enjoy the journey you are on.

__label__1 , why do cops get harassed for doing their job?,If the person would listen to their commands, there would not be a problem.  If that Rodney king criminal would have given up, there would be no beating (that he deserved).  Cops should be allowed to beat or shoot if necessary.  If a cop tells me to stop or lay down, I am going to do it.,Cause people need someone to blame for their problems.  If people did what they were told my best friend who is a cop wouldn't need a tazar, nightstick, and pepperspray to go with his gun.  People always want to put down cops, but who do they call when some punk is stealing their car?

Since my mom is a nurse I can only go to the gym a couple of times a week if that,and I can only stay one hour before they kick us out.So can anyone give me some advice?,Buy a skipping rope.  Skip for a couple of minutes, several times during the day, you can do it rain or shine.  Dogs won't chase you down the street.  You won't trip on ice, stones etc.  It is not expensive.  It gets your heart rate going faster than tread mill and takes up less space when you put it away.  You can also take it travelling with you.\nIt develops secondary skills, balance, ever seen a fat boxer?

As well as four running XP Pro and XP MPE. \nIn storage, I also have one that runs on BASIC from DOS. All of them work fine and out of all of them I think that 3.1.5 and 95 where the most stable platforms I have owned!\nKeep up the good work and don't bow down to pressure.

Someone has to be the fall guy right now.  Why not let it be Bush, right?  Everyone is running out buying Bill Clinton books and laughing at his jokes.  Bill's the one laughing.  No one seems to remember that he was the guy in office during the 9/11 planning, but he was too busy getting serviced by the interns in the Oval office to care about National Security.  But luckily for Bill, no one remembers that.  People just remember who was in office when it happened - Bush - and he's to blame for the downfall from there.  So, no, let's not pretend another Democrat is in office.

__label__10 , Assuming one could emmigrate out of the USA and to another country, How does the US treat such people?,I'm kinda curious to know how easy it is to leave the US legally and go elsewhere? Anyone ever done it? Is it biz as usual or do the Feds make a stink?,People emmigrate from the US all the time.  I don't understand your question here.  Are you already illegally in the US and so you wonder if you could leave, say on an airplane or ship to another country, whether US immigration would stop you?  If so, I don't think so.  You would have to make it through the customs of the country you were going to, though, and if you did not have legal documentation to show for your being in the US, they may not let you into their country.  Could try it - also depends on which country you are planning on going to.  However, if you are not presently legally in the US, you won't be able to return legally and would eventually be deported from the country you are in back to your own home country and not to the US.

__label__9 , why does it hurt when having sex for the first couple of times?,,Never underestimate the power of foreplay.\n\nI remember years ago, when I was dating my ex wife, we had been living together for some time.  She complained to me once of it being painful, and we had been sexually active for months.  She asked her Gyneocoligst about this, and he informed her that her cervix was a bit smaller then average.  He then suggested foreplay.\n\nShe then came to me and talked with me about it.  So we tried slowing things down a bit before penetration.  She set the pace, and decided when she was ready, and we had a very satisfying sex life there after.\n\nTalk with your b/f or husband about this, explain to him that you find it painful, and that he should take more time to prepare you.  This is done in so many ways, touching, insertion of the finger/s.  You set the pace, and when you feel you are aroused enough (wet!) then you tell him you want him, and he should be gentle and easy at first, and build things up from there.\n\nIf you are having issues with self lubrication (meaning you just dont seem to get very wet, and dont worry this is not all that uncommon), then try using personal lubricant, there are many products on the market to help you enjoy your sex life, and make sex much more comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nBeyond that, breathe, and relax, and focus on him, and enjoying everything that he is doing to you :)

I have a 3.7 GPA and have done so well in college for the past 4 1/2 years. Right now I hate it so much, I'm so burned out an just want it to be over.

__label__4 , are online courses people take harder to do or is it easier in a classroom?,,I have been taking online courses now for almost a year and a half and have found that the program is very rewarding!  I have felt alot less pressure than having traditional classroom instruction.  Although there are several different aspects of online courses, there are many things that have been done through many colleges and universities to bring the online students together.  For example, with the classes that I have taken, there is a discussion board that allows you and other classmates to post interesting topics and help each other with puzzling issues that may arise during the completion of coursework.  In addition, if extra help is needed, there is generally a phone number that you can call for technical support or for assistance.  This can prove to be especially useful when you are enrolled in a math course.  You can e-mail assignments whenever you like, watch lectures on DVD or videotape whenever you like, and do classwork at your convenience.  It actually saves alot of time since you don't have to commute to school and spend alot of time getting ready to go to class.  You can sit at home and do your work in your pajamas! :o)  One thing that I would highly recommend is that you be mindful of the concept of networking and forming outside interests while you are completing your coursework.  Since you are not physically attending classes at a college or university, you still need sufficient time for social activities.  Some colleges give you a start date and an end date to complete coursework.  It is up to you to plan your schedule accordingly.  If you do decide to take an online class, I would recommend that you establish a schedule immediately for your coursework when you get the syllabus and list of assignments.  Make sure that you complete the assignments in a timely fashion.  It also helps to have a buddy that will hold you accountable for completing your reading and written assignments.  I'm sure that this policy will vary from college to college, but when it comes time to take exams, often times with the online class, the professor will not give a time limit and you can take all the time that you want to complete your exam in the presence of a proctor.  This really takes off alot of pressure.  Allow for plenty of time to complete assignments and if you can do it, try to complete your coursework in advance.  If you are an independent learner and don't like to waste time, online classes might be for you.  I hope that some of these suggestions may be helpful to you.  If you want to talk more about online classes, you may shoot me a note.

I have a 256 pc2700 and a 512 pc2100 no i do know it will make the pc operate at 2100 speed , but is it really that noticable. how much speed am i losing?,depends. pc2700 is better because it is faster memory than pc2100. But, remember, if you have a pc/laptop that accepts pc2100, then you can put a pc2700 memory in it but it will not make your laptop faster. It works only because all memory modules are backward compatible and work with old slots but will not be able to take advantage of the speed capabilities of the newer memory modules.

Step aerobics, walking on a treadmill, & dance these all burn calories. But you must do a cardio exercise at least 30 min 3 times a week. To see rapid results a hour 5 days a week. The Weight lifting also burns calories but also builds muscle. If you eat right & exercise you can turn fat calories into fuel and gain muscle and trim your self. Remember muscle weights more than fat. So if you get on the scale and you don't see a dramatic change at first don't get discouraged. If I were you I would do a combo of both cardio for 20-30min then lift for 40-30min. You should notice a change within 3-5 weeks.

There are those who require your unyielding conformity and any sign of individual thinking is frowned upon. Beware of those type of people. God gave you a mind and it would be a sin not to use it.

He deserves an opportunity to redeem himself. If he fails we will all have the answer.

__label__7 , can a hospital  sue for unpaid medical bill?,,Not only can they sue -- they will sue. And when (not if) they win, they will garnish your wages for the original bill plus hefty late fees and interest (usually done by the collection agency they turn your bill over to). I have several people working for me who are having their wages garnished now for medical bills. Best get on, and stick to, a payment plan now. These bill do not just go away. \n\nDon't be fooled into thinking that a non-profit hospital is a charity. The two words are not synonyms. This mentality is just one of the many causes of the rise in healthcare costs. Hospitals spend millions trying to collect unpaid bills. If you were sick, and you received the care, you owe the money.

__label__6 , Why does my bike need a tune up?,Please fogive me for being so ignorant about this. I know the brakes work well, there is a little rust on the chain, and the seat seems to be in working order. So why do I need a bike tune up?,Cables stretch. Shifting becomes just a little bit slower and sloppier and braking starts to be less responsive. Wheels are the biggest items that need retensioning. Also bearings on the bottom bracket, hubs and headset can become sloppy and be damaged if not optimally tightened and lubed. Little things like handlebars and seatposts and saddles that are just out of adjustment can be tightened and straightened out. Plus, they usually give the bike a good cleaning which makes it work better. A more expensive bike built with very good parts may not need everything done as often but more modest bikes definitely need a good going over every year. Winter is an awesome time to get these things done.

If you don't get an answer within 24 hours, it is best to delete your query and ask again.\nSurendra, I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal opinion. You have been foolish, Surendra. Very, very foolish. Anyone can see that the purpose of Yahoo! Answers is to serve as a modern chatroom. More and more, Java programming is becoming less and less supported, there is no other method of bringing people together in a social environment than to create PHP scripts where the thinking can be done on the server rather than on your machine. With that in mind, Surendra, you should interrogate the shallow-minded participants of Yahoo! Answers with matters that appeal to their common denominator. Questions such as, How long is the normal tally whacker? or, My boyfriend says I should dump my hubby, what you think?..., would get you a substantial number of replies.\nGive up your pursuit of truth and petty wonders, Surendra. Quit asking bland, colorless questions. Are you naive? No person who is capable of giving you the answer you hoped for can last while reading though a heap of puddings, pies and pastry. I'm only doing you a favor, Surendra, by giving you a proper admonishment you can now begin to formulate an apology. When you are ready, send your atonement to http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my;_ylt=Aq_EtUR9D0EBSZBgHXjWjQ3py6IX \nAnd Surendra, if you insist upon asking serious questions, remember that a few good jolts from a peace officer's tazor should bring you around to your senses. Please, check your spelling and throw some slang into the mix so you don't offend any of the egos lurking, waiting to pounce with crass, thoughtless one-liners.\n\nThank you Surendra, and have a great day!\n-Gabe

__label__6 , what do u think about tennssee walking cross with a quarter horse?,,Depending on what you intend to do with the colt/filly when the broodmare foals. Breeding is not a science, it is an art or a highly probable degree of expectancy from the results, at best. \n\nChances are, by crossing a Tennessee Walker with a Quarter Horse, you will not get a faster quarter horse. With over two hundred disciplines, many horses carry their traits to their offspring and are bred for a particular reason.\n\nBy crossing the two disciplines, the Quarter Horse and the Tennesssee Walker, you may get a better cutting horse, that may be needed for farming, or a better dressage horse, where appearance weighs a lot in judging or challenging the grand prix circuit with a hunter-jumper, might be an interesting idea.\n\nHowever, the down side of it all is that when you cross breed specific horse disciplines, you may also be inviting a genetic inheritance that could effect the progeny. For example, it has been noted that many bred thoroughbreds  from the Bold Ruler blood line carry arthritis into the genetic structure off any foals born of that line. Laminitis, a hoof condition that caused the death of Secretariat, a direct decedent of Bold Ruler, colt-progeny, may also be an inherited trait, doubtful, but a possibility. Only time will afford blood lines genetic structures to be noticed and determined. And, even over time, one negative trait may disappear with the breeding of the progeny to another blood line.\n\nTo make any assumption as to what to expect from any type of breeding, you need to know the intended purpose of an owner of the eventual foal. In essence, the question is thrown back to you as to what do you expect to do with the foal from the breeding of a Tennessee Walker and a Quarter Horse.\n\nIt would be a good idea to check with the equine veterinarian within your community or any college or university to deteremine if the combination of a Tennessee Walker with a Quarter Horse will produce what degree of success. The University of Colorado has an excellent equine breeding curriculum as does Kentucky.\n\nRemember, you must first deteremine your intentions before you breed any specific discipline with any other specific discipline. And, have a knowledgeable veterinarian carry the broodmare to full term.\n\nYou may want to look into artificial insemination and genetic engineering before doing any seriuous cross breeding between the equine disciplines...Good Luck.

Now, for those that don't know, I am trying to start a newspaper or magazine column in which teenagers can write in and ask me things they either can't or won't ask any other adult. I'm a Mom and my daughter's friends always asked me for advice whenever they couldn't talk to their parents about it. What I need to know is; should I name the column Ask Mom or Ask Tina? Remember that I need to get the idea across that I am an adult and a Mom too so which name would you feel better about? Thank you all for your help. =),I'm not a teenager anymore (darn it!), but...\n\nHow about Ask Tina Anything -- this would give them the idea that you are open to answer any question without emphasising the idea that you are Mom. \n\nIf they wanted to ask a Mom, they would ask their own. It may be comforting for them to know that you have kids, and ARE a mom, but teens won't want you to be Mom first when they ask a question.\n\nGreat idea, and I wish you well!

__label__1 , Why Can't Women Take Emergency Pills After 52 Hours Of Unprotected Contact?,Well, I know this should have been in the Pregnancy category, but this may involve more moral issues than it seems. I'm a volunteer at a family planning org. in a country where abortion is illegal, and I've asked this question but the answers so far have been varied, which makes it confusing.,surely its more to do with the effectiveness of the pill. in britain you can take it upto 72 hours later, but if you wait that long its only 50% as likely to prevent pregnancy than if you take it straight away.\n\ni think its more to do with the fact that the longer you leave it, the more likely it is that the embryo will have planted itself in the uterine lining, and that the body will have signalled the release of progesterone - the pregnancy hormone. after this time, you are pregnant, and only a much stronger pill that will cuase contractions of the unterus to dispell the embryo, will work.
__label__1 , Why attacking Mexicans?,Ever since 9-11, people again have been targeted Mexicans & Mexican-Americans. The Terriorists enter the Canadian Border not Mexican Border. They have been targeted by Immigration, not the Arabs. When has Mexicans commited a Terriot Act in USA? I could mention alot Terrorists Acts by Causian Americans. Mexico is peaceful Country, there is crime, but every Country has that problem especially USA. Remember USA went through Mafia & Gangster Days.,It's true, even though your spelling and grammar is atrocious, you are absolutley right!  My boyfriend is a Mexican-American, and we live pretty close to the border, and everything you say about the border issues, terrorism, etc. is true.  Unfortunately, there is no good reason, other than politics as usual.\n\nUntil we can all agree that only the native Americans can morally gripe about any of us coming into this country illegally, I say we stuff this debate where it belongs!  In the trash!!!\n\nPRACTICE TOLERANCE!!!

__label__6 , As a fan/player, have you ever witnesed any racism in the NFL in the calls by the referee's, commentators, etc,Ray Lewis Out of Order in McNair's Case\nFuture Hall of Famer Erroneously Played Race Card\nBy JASON WHITLOCK\n\n. Ray Lewis forgot the golden rule when it comes playing the race card: You lose the right to play it once an NFL franchise and the league stands by you when you face murder charges.\n\nI like Ray Lewis – on the football field. As a spokesman for social justice, Ray Ray needs to sit in the back of the limo and keep his mouth shut.\n\nLewis’ rant suggesting that the Titans wouldn’t have treated white NFL superstar quarterbacks – Peyton Manning and Brett Favre – the way the organization treated Steve McNair is Exhibit A in why today’s filthy rich athlete has zero business trying to mimic Jim Brown, Muhammad Ali or John Carlos.\n\nRay doesn’t realize had Tony Siragusa stood trial for murder, the Baltimore Ravens likely would’ve cut ties with the overweight nose tackle. \n\nYour thoughts on racism and the NFL...Fact or fiction?,NO.............

What do girls thank of guys like this?,You shouldn't worry about what we (girls) think!\nI love Fall out Boy and Panic! at the Disco (I love their CD'S). I think it is awesome that your able to identify with a any type of music, but still keep your style how you like it. I mean, I listen a lot to rock now, but you wouldn't know I enjoy it just by looking at me! Congratulations you have broken a stereotype! \nJust think of it as a surprise for a girl!

__label__4 , Im looking to major in Sports management and I'd like to go to a big D1 school prefarbly in the South.?,What are some schools I should consider? Right now im focused on U  texas and Umiami and I know that not all schools offer the major. If theres a school with a similiar major (economics or business or somthin) that works too. \n\nSchool spirit is key and so are good looking women,Texas has some pretty attractive women and Utexas is a pretty awesome school, very well known and has great school spirit.\n\nBut I have to plug for my school, cause it's overlooked by most sports fans.  Baylor is D1 and it also has a nationally acclaimed Sports Sponsorship and Sales Program.  You should seriously check it out, it's very good and the only program like it (see link below).  \n\nAttractive women: We're consistently ranked in the top 10 (usually top 3) of Play Boy.  \n\nSchool spirit: If you're a sports fan, the campus is nice because the athletes there are very visible on campus and easy to talk to, you can't help but to meet them and you'll likely have classes with several from all sports, especially if you're a business major or even if you just enjoy going to the pool or a local hang out.  Without even meaning to, I'm friends with some from football, M&W bball, track, baseball, soccer and tennis, they're just normal students.  It's a lot more fun to cheer for people when you know them.
__label__10 , An email address to write note of displeasure concerning new bill to the Senate?,Who can we write to to tell them of our displeasure concerning the handling of the illegal immigration thang!? I've written to my Senator, my Cogress person, my president (small p intentional) Quien Mas? Who else?,The Senate has already passed the bill for amnesty. They also attached a provision that the United States has to consult and get permission from Mexico before doing border control. We have been sold out to Mexico.\n\nThe illegal Mexican immigrants are invading this country trying to take it over. It's encouraged by Mexico and the American businesses who use them for cheap labor. Their loyalty is to Mexico. They proved that during one of the first rallies when they took down the American flag, hung up the Mexican flag, and then hung the American flag upside down underneath it. THAT is how they feel about America. \n\nhttp://michellemalkin.com/archives/004869.htm

__label__10 , Poltical leaders...?,Why is it that everytime we vote for someone for office we praise that person during the elections, as soon as they get to office people start to look down on the efforts of the person we voted for. It is a continous circle- like bill clition, just cause he had an affiar with a lady we hated his guts even though we loved the guy when he was running for presedent. No matter who is it we still wont agree with the person - it is like america has a trust issue or something.,Not everybody praises people while they are running but there is so much hype with campaign promises and coventions that people just go a little crazy. \n\nBut yes there are always going to be critics and it is just human nature. No matter what a president/government does to help one group it will hurt another. So yeah America doesn't really have a trust issue but it does have a lot of pissed off people...they are angry..

__label__1 , What's Up With These Boycotting Christians?,Can you believe I was approached by a Christian group and asked to boycott a company because they provide health benefits for partners of gay employees? \n\nWhat's up with that? If you disagree with homosexuality then by all means do  not go to a gay event or fund a gay organisation or read gay literature etc. But WHY would any Christiain want to deliberately cause hardship for someone else's family? How does a gay employee being able to get health insurance for his loved one threaten YOU or encroach on YOUR faith or YOUR family? Aren't some needs BASIC to all?\n\nAre you going to boycott companies that offer health insurance to non-Christians who worship idols? After all, idolatry is against the bible not so? What about companies that allow obese people to work there? Gluttony is against the bible not so? When does it end? When companies ONLY hire people from YOUR Christian sect who apply the bible as YOU do?\n\nWhen does it stop being about morality and start getting meanspirited?,I think you're right. Most Christian boycotters are very selective in who they boycott. Homosexuality is one hot spot.\n\nTo be honest, if they boycott every company that had a disagreement with their theology, they couldn't buy anything at all. They should be living somewhere in hovels, without power, clothes, and food.\n\nIn any case, our job is to be salt in the world, not constantly protest what the world is doing.\n\nIf they are so worried about homosexuality, they would do much better being friends with homosexuals, finding out their needs, and serving them as real people whom they cared about, instead of impersonally fighting to simply take things away from them that they really do need.

__label__1 , If a vampire were Jewish, would his Sabbath start at sunrise ?,,Sabbath is determined by God, not by the individual. So, no.  Sabbath always starts just before the sun sets on the 6th day of the week (friday), and ends after the sun sets at the end of the next day.\n\nSecondly, drinking blood (whether animal or human) is forbidden by Torah.  Therefore, a Jew is not permitted to be a vampire of any sort.
__label__10 , Liberal Media vs. Republican Media - any middle ground?,It seems that the Republicans are saying that the media is all owned and operated by liberals but FOX and all it's affiliated stations are quite the opposite.\n\nWho do you turn to for real non-partisan news?\nSerious answers only please - nobody likes a flamer.,One thing to keep in mind is that the mainstream media whether FOX, MSNBC, CNN, and the TV networks ABC, NBC, CBS, etc., are all owned by about 6 mega-corporations...\n\nand all these corporations are for profit - which means that their main goal is to keep you watching - watching and hopefully buying what they are selling via commercials. Trust me, their main goal is NOT to inform you about what you need to know WHEN you need to know it...\n\nSo my point here is that there is no real liberal or conservative media per se.  Yes, the reporters may tend to be more liberal, but the EDITING decisions are made by the suits, and there are way more conservatives in control at this level.  \n\nWhat you may not realize are the ties the media has to government - and how they work hand in hand to censor the important news you really need to know.\n\nSo the short answer is:  Check out the internet but pay close attention to the source - after a while you will be able to tell when you have reached a credible source or not.  European media has some of the same problems (propagana via corporate control) but they are way ahead of the U.S. when it comes to telling more of the truth - especially about us!  \n\nAn admittedly liberal site http://www.buzzflash.com will give you links to stories all over the world.  But, while they *are* liberal, they are actually linking to the original story in whatever media it was originally reported - so you can read the original story and decide for yourself.  http://www.truthout.org is another similar type site without all the added commentary (editoralizing)...\n\nDo some searches on the web for WHO OWNS THE MEDIA and you'll see for yourself why the media censors your news.\n\nThink about this:  GE makes bombs for the military.  GE also owns NBC.  Now, if you PROFIT from making bombs, what is your motivation to tell the American public the WHOLE truth in advance of a war?  Better to let some of the truth out about fake wars AFTER they have begun.  They aren't going to admit to being war profiteers, but the fact of the matter is that they DO profit from war.  Do the math.

__label__1 , 20 somethings.talk to me?,I attend a very liberal progressive Church. (The United Church of Christ) We are the ones that had the advertising that was banned from some major networks. (see site www.stillspeaking.com)\nI just went to a workshop where I learned that 80% of people in thier 20's do not attend Chruch. That number was staggering to me. Can you young people tell me why you don't go? Is it boring? Do you not feel welcome? I'd like to work on this with my local church. Give me you're ideas. What could I say or do that would help you feel welcome? And, how many of you have attended church in the past? What was missing for you?,I don't go to church, even though I believ in God, and Jesus Christ, because I was tired of going to church and listening to people talk about how they are a better christian than someone else.  God is the only one who can judge us. All these people talking about how good they are... I don't need that.  Also, I feel that we need to read between the lines of many things in the bible.  Ways change.  Just because it was like 2000+ years ago, doesn't mean that it has to be that way now.  Many things in the bible are the way they are for societal reasons. Not because God said so. The bible was written by men, and is then questionable. The easiest way to get people to do or not do something, is to make it Holy Law. If I'm passing on, orally, the bible and I feel like saying you can't eat pigs, because I think they are dirty.  Whose to stop me from saying, God, said this!  If God is everywhere why do I have to go to church to worship Him?  Can't I go up to the mountains where I can see His work, and worship on my own there?  I have a beautiful wife and a baby boy.  I can see God's work right there.  I don't need to go to church have someone tell me, about His work.  Why am I going to give money to the church for God? God doesn't need money. Does anyone else think it odd that televangelists and some real preachers are driving around in Cadillacs and Mercedes', and BMWs?  While their flock drives clunkers. I know not all are like that, but you get my idea.   I believe in God.  I've lost faith in the church.

__label__3 , Have you ever hated yourself? Why? How could you get over it?,,Yes, you do feel guilty when you've sinned or hurt others who don't deserve such injustice.\nOr when you've caused trouble for others because of something you did. \n\nThe best way is to ask God for forgiveness because sometimes it is better we don't approach the person we've hurt. Further communication no matter the good intent may ignite the situation more.\n\nAnother way, is to avoid thinking too much about it by focussing on other things after you've asked God for forgiveness. Sports has always been a good outlet to distract oneself from the difficult things we have to face.

Just 60 years ago the speen of sound was the limit, and just 100 years ago we could not fly at all.\nI think the really fast is true.,It could be possible, although I doubt if you could actually replace relativity with some other theory that could allow that. So for now it's not possible maybe in future. \nI believe that because think about it before relativity we all thought that time was constant. \n\nPlus even if we can't reach speed of light, we might be able to get close to it which can let us travel farther cause of time dilation. I don't think you could go back in time though.

The time to come together to solve this problem is now – TAKE ACTION
__label__9 , Why Do Men Wait For A Special Occasion To Show There Mate How Much They Love Them?,Ladies, how many of you have men who wait until a special occasion before they buy you flowers or chocolates or does something nice for you? If they are with you and love you all so very much, shouldn't they be showing that love 24-7, 365 instead of when a particular day and/or date comes up? Again, LADIES, is this something you are comfortable with or are you really wishing that your mate would show a little more LOVE when its not a certain day of the year. I ain't hatin' on the fella's, I'm just trying to get at a basic truth here and find out what the LADIES have to say about the matter at hand. LADIES, EXPRESS YOURSELF!!!,You're a guy, so I guess I should be asking YOU that question :)\n\nMy boyfriend used to be like that.  He always thought I'd be around and didn't really appreciate me.  One day I got sick of it and said something.  Usually it takes more than saying something one time for it to make a change, but he did.  Now he appreciates me all the time.  He does really cute little things.  For example, he bought me this silly St. Patrick's Day pin at work one day.  I thought it was so sweet!  I love little things like this.  When he has a day off and I have to work, he always cooks me dinner.  I'm really lucky...and I remember to APPRECIATE IT!
__label__1 , Who really believes that Alexander the Great was really Bi-Sexual?,I'm still a little iffy about that. Does anyone have any great literature that proofs he swung the other way?,It's fairly well-established that he had a male lover.  It really wasn't uncommon in those days.  In ancient Greece, older men often wooed a younger man.  The men would teach the youths wisdom and how to conduct themselves properly in society, and they would get some play for their troubles.  Read Plato's _Symposium_.  It's pretty awesome.  These guys all got drunk and started talking about love, and there was a speech or two claiming that the love between two men (and they don't mean chaste, platonic love) was higher than that between a man and a woman, because it was between equals.

__label__2 , do animals have a sense of not to breed with a member of the same family?,,It really depends on the organism. Some have behavioral adaptations to avoid inbreeding, but in general one should assume that animals (except the ones with very large brains and social structures) don't have the capacity to recognize kin, certainly not as kin (i.e. they know this is their brother, parent, etc.). But they don't need to if, for example, they instinctively disperse at weaning, etc. However, you may want to consult this article by someone who's done a lot of work on this topic: http://www.bio.unc.edu/faculty/pfennig/lab/pfennig_files/kinrecoginization.htm
__label__10 , Why do the conservatives want us to stay and pay in Iraq?,Cant they see we will just keep losing troops. Lives are valuable and nothing is about to change,George Bush illegally and unconstitutionally invaded another sovereign nation for only two resons: 1) He wanted to 'get even' with Saddam Husseing for humiliating his daddy during Desert Storm, and 2) Big Dick Cheney wants oil that oil that' swimming underneath Iraq's sands. Until he has a rock-solid, iron-clad arrangements in place, NO TROOPS WILL BE WITHDRAWN FROM IRAQ. After all, Cheney's buddies at Halliburton and Exxon-Mobil need to get richer and richer and richer.\n\nBush, Cheney and Rumsfeld are the most evil, corrupt, and incompetent morons ever to occupy the White House. The current U.S. Congress is the most evil, corrupt and incompetent body ever to occupy the Capitol Building.\n\nThese people all deserve to be impeached or tried for high treason. If convicted, tehy deserve to face a public firing squad.\n\nCheck out the new blog - BUSHWACKER!\nwww.blogger.com\nhttp://al-aback.blogspot.com\n\nCertainly Satan has reserved a special oil-soaked corner of Hell for Bush, Cheny and Rumsfeld where they can spend their eternal damnation blaming each other for destroying the Earth.\nBush has not done ONE productive thing since he stole the last two elections. However, he has:\n\n1. Massacred tens of thousands of Iraq's citizens and 2,500 U.S. soldiers;\n2. Turned America into a police state where his billion-dollar boondoggle, Homeland Security, considers everyone guilty until proven innocent;\n3. Tarnished America's reputation as a global leader and worldwide peacekeeper;\n4. Contributed to the demise of the Earth through failed environmental and ecological policies;\n5. Virtually eliminated the American middle class to a point where, within a generation, the U.S. will be a two-tiered society like Haiti and the Dominican Republic: there will be the very, very rich (Bush's buddies) and (the rest of us) the very, very poor;\n6. Put the USA trillions of dollars into debt, which will take generations to pay off (if it ever can);\n7. Neglected the poor, the sick, the aged, the disabled, the hungry and the disadvantaged in America;\n8. Greedily played Robin Hood in Reverse by taking from the poor and giving to his rich friends, special interest groups, lobbyists, and mega-corporations who in turn make generous (if not illegal) campaign contributions to the GOP;\n9. Given every other country in the world reason to fear us and a motivation to build their own nuclear weapons with which to protect themselves from the new evil empire, the USA;\n10. Tortured prisoners, most of whom are being held without legitimate charges, and most of whom are being tortured outside of the rules of the Geneva Convention.\n\nThomas Jefferson once said: 'The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. That time is way past due. It's time for a new American Revolution that will completely demolish the Republican and Democratic parties and eliminate the stranglehold these wicked power brokers have on American politics.
__label__3 , why won't the powers that be admit that the bird flu has mutated and is contagoius between humans ?,,Yes, it has mutated and IS contagious between humans.  For the H5N1 bird flu virus strain to become a serious threat to human health it will need to mutate further. At the moment it does not infect humans easily, it very rarely jumps from human to human. However, if it infects a human who already has the normal human flu, it could then exchange genetic information with the human flu virus and acquire the ability to transmit from human-to-human easily - a new mutation. Then, we could be facing a serious flu pandemic that would spread around the world within a matter of weeks.

__label__9 , How many people don't get engagement rings?,I've heard of couples with really cheap wedding/engagement rings or just none at all...,Yes, it happens.  But I've found the cheap rings usually mean more than the expensive ones.\n\nWhen my husband and I got married, we were poor college students with no jobs so he couldn't afford an engagement ring.  On our honeymoon, we went to a small antique store and saw a beautiful ring -- it was bright green crystal set in sterling silver -- and it was $10.  The man we bought it from warned it was expensive.  Since my husband had $10, he got me the ring and to this day we refer to it as my very expensive ring.  Although he now has a good job and we are no longer poor, I love that ring and will never get another one.  For me, it is worth more than all the gold and diamonds in the world.
__label__9 , how can u tell if a girl is faking or not under the sheets?,,I gotta say, there is only one reason a girl fakes it...and that is to make YOU feel good or feel better about YOURSELF...cause she is worried you have too fragile an ego to deal with the fact that she might not totally enjoy being w you. SO>>> I think you gotta talk to her and somehow gain a little confidence in yourself and your ability. The problem isn't her. If she is not faking it, great. If she is, I think you gotta turn the mirror on yourself and ask why. In either case....SHE is not the issue here!

__label__4 , Did the american civil war result in creation of USA and Canada? Some history would help.?,,No. The Civil war took place approximately a hundred years AFTER the USA became a country, and was a war between the citizens of the US, mainly between northern states and southern states.  One of the main effects of the civil war was abolishment of slavery in the USA.\n\nIn the late 1700's, the Revolutionary War took place. This was is the one where the outcome was a seperation of America from English Rule.\n\nCanada, however, did NOT seperate from England. To this day, they have English Monarchs on their money. (Ever look at a Canadian coin?)  Canada is a province with The Queen of England, it's highest authority.\n\nhttp://www.let.rug.nl/usa/H/index.htm\n\nThis is a good site to read up on USA history.\n\n\nIf you'd like a summary of Canadian information, look here:\nhttp://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ca.html

Choose the wise and safe way !!!,Descartes said the same thing.\n\nIf the God that you believe in is naive enough to be fooled by such reductive reasoning, he surely must not be worthy of your, or anyone's, faith.\n\nThe wise and safe way is always the correct way; the one that stays firm to your beliefs and convictions. If you are a believer only because you are afraid of hell, then I seriously doubt your convictions.\n\nPeace :)

We all agree that the universe exists. Astronomers have observed that the universe is organized into a system of galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and super clusters of clusters of galaxies.  \n\nIf you're open to the possibility of a higher power, you'd have to ask if this power is responsible for the universe.  If you answer yes, then your next question is, is the universe an act of creation, or is it an accident?  Either way, your next question is why?  This line of questioning will bring you either to the biblical explanation of god, or the scientific explanation of god.
__label__7 , Can you give me info on Hurricanes for an school project, I am not sure what I need? I hope you can help me.?,Where do hurricanes come from? How are they formed? Please provided any other info, you think will help complete, this project.,Hurricane, name applied to migratory tropical cyclones that originate over oceans in certain regions near the equator, and particularly to those arising in the West Indian region, including the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane-type cyclones in the western Pacific are known as typhoons.\n\nMost hurricanes originate within the doldrums, a narrow equatorial belt characterized by intermittent calms, light variable breezes, and frequent squalls, and lying between the northeast and southeast trade winds. As the doldrums of the Atlantic are situated largely to the north of the equator, hurricanes do not occur in the South Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific doldrums extend north and south of the equator; thus hurricanes occur in the South and North Pacific oceans.\n\nHurricanes consist of high-velocity winds blowing circularly around a low-pressure center, known as the eye of the storm. The low-pressure center develops when the warm, saturated air prevalent in the doldrums is underrun and forced upward by denser, cooler air. From the edge of the storm toward its center, the atmospheric pressure drops sharply and the wind velocity rises. The winds attain maximum force close to the point of lowest pressure (about 724 torr, or about 28.5 in. of mercury). The diameter of the area affected by winds of destructive force may exceed 240 km (150 mi). Gale winds prevail over a larger area, averaging 480 km (300 mi) in diameter. The strength of a hurricane is rated from 1 to 5. The mildest, Category 1, has winds of at least 120 km/h (74 mph). The strongest (and rarest), Category 5, has winds that exceed 250 km/h (155 mph). Within the eye of the storm, which averages 24 km (15 mi) in diameter, the winds stop and the clouds lift, but the seas remain very violent.\n\nHurricanes generally move in a path resembling the curve of a parabola. In the northern hemisphere the storms usually travel first in a northwesterly direction and in the higher latitudes turn toward the northeast. In the southern hemisphere the usual path of the hurricane is initially to the southwest and subsequently to the southeast. Hurricanes travel at varying rates. In the lower latitudes the rate ranges from 8 to 32 km/h (5 to 20 mph) and in the higher latitudes it may increase to as much as 80 km/h (50 mph). Those areas in which the hurricane winds blow in the same direction as the general movement of the storm are subjected to the maximum destructive violence of the hurricane.\n\nSince 1943 U.S. military aircraft have been flying into hurricanes to measure wind velocities and directions, the location and size of the eye, the pressures within the storms, and their thermal structure. A coordinated system of tracking hurricanes was developed in the mid-1950s, and periodic improvements have been made over the years. Radar, sea-based recording devices, geosynchronous weather satellites (since 1966), and other devices now supply data to the National Hurricane Center in Florida, which follows each storm virtually from the beginning. Improved systems of prediction and communication have been able to help minimize loss of life in hurricanes, but property damage is still heavy, especially in coastal regions. The strongest hurricane to hit the western hemisphere in the 20th century, Gilbert, devastated Jamaica and parts of Mexico in 1988 with winds that gusted up to 350 km/h (218 mph). Destructive hurricanes in recent U.S. history include Hugo (1989), with $4.2 billion in damage and more than 50 deaths, and Andrew (1992), with $15.5 billion in damage, more than 50 dead, and thousands left homeless

Food does not stay in my stomach at all.I have been refered 4 times now to get a Neurostimulator put in, with no response from any doctor, and when I call, they say they will get back with me and never do.,No, don't try to make appointments yourself.

I paid for it the 1st year i was in and when i got out i did NOT see gi bill info on my discharge papers. Is it supposed to me on my DD-214? Is there a way i can find out if i have it?,Hey there.  I just researched my DD-214 from top to bottom and it didn't have any info on it either about the MGIB.  When I decided to go to college last year I called 1-800-827-1000.  This phone number is generalized to route you to your nearest VA regional office (it does this automatically).  Whoever answers will put you in touch with a vocational rehabilitation couselor that will explain your options of the two programs.  I opted to accept the MGIB option because it pays you cash every month and you decide, based on full or part time college how much you will have from that cash every month.  The VR (Vocational Rehabilitation Program) is different.  If you sign up with either program you will be scheduled a class about the pros and cons of both programs.  The MGIB was the bread winner in my selection, but the down fall of it is if you withdraw early and spend your tuition money on other things, you will be left a nasty bill from your college.  With the VR program, you never see your tuition money because the finance office pays the college and you don't get any cash to play with.  Also, in the VR program if your grades start slipping or if your absent from school, you'll have to 'answer' to 'big brother'.  It's really your choice which program you choose, as long as your responsible enough to pay your bills on time and not fraternize with the co-ed's, like I did.  Either way, though, you'll recieve a letter of eligibility and alot of late nights and early mornings....studying, of course!
__label__9 , Okay boys, whats the difference between a girl you want to get to know ...?,and a girl you want to just have sex with.. IE persontality, looks, status..?,The answers where other have stated what is the difference is not far off to what the true answer is.   Initially, most guy has \nthe urge to get laid but as they get older they should start to change.  Remember that me are visual creatures and women are more verbal creaturs.  As you get older men want start to change.  I think your question can not be truely answered due to every man is different and do not all want the same things such as sex (Yes, it is true all men are not male chovanist pigs).  I think the best answer to your question is that if you have a conversation with a guy and he calls and or continues to show interst then your traits are what he is looking for.  I personally enjoy a woman that can have fun and is strong willed due to I do not want a woman whom I have to babysit and reassure her that she has self worth because I do not have time to that but other guys may want to have a girl that they want to baby and to be the provider.

I would like to file for divorce here in Arizona, but I don't want to be here or come back for any of the process.  Can I complete the process without physically being here?,Is he in Arizona?\n\nUsually somebody has to be a resident.  If you move somewhere else, you're no longer a resident.\n\nAre there children involved or property?  \n\nYou need to ask an attorney.  I'm going to guess the answer will be no, if neither of you are residents of the state.  However, I could be wrong.

__label__1 , if i know something for a fact am i stupid to put it to the test?,if i inhale water i will drown, jump into lava i will burn. these things i know will happen so im not going to test them out, it would be stupid. so why then do christians go on about god being all knowing and then tell you that this life is a trial devised by god to test your faith. an all knowing being would know the outcome of any test in advance. why bother?,If I wasn't sure whether I'd drown or not I wouldn't inhale water to test it.  The reason you wouldn't test those things is because they could have dangerous outcomes, not because you already know the outcomes.  Of course testing people's faith can have dangerous outcomes as well, so God sure is being an idiot there.

__label__9 , HOW would you tell your boyfriend that he need to be more romantic?,If you were in relationship with a guy for 6 years, he is a few years older and you both share a child and you love him very much but the problem is he is so unromantic. You give him hints but he just don't catch on. He does no romantic thing for you not even on specail occassions and he does not like to go out, this just let you feel unattractive, but you love this guy world without end but you are longing for some real romance.,As a guy, I have experience in this.  When women talk, they are talking in a different language.  In my experience, women beat around the bush.  I don't know what kind of hints you are dropping but you need to be up front, direct. Give him some hints of what would be nice.  He may not realize what you are hinting to.  I know I never had a clue when I was being hinted to.  It took me several years.  Go to the book store and get Men are from Mars and Woman are from Venus.  It says allot.  I think I is a great book.  I am sure that there are several books that give you a little more insight on the male mind but that is a good start.  DONT GIVE UP ON HIM.  Both of you need to sit down and discuss things keeping an open mind and promising that no matter what is said, you won't take offense to it.  It needs to be a conversation that will bring the two of you closer, not a conversation that will drive a stake into either of your hearts.  It is easy to think someone is picking up on your hints.....but sometimes the hints go unnoticed.  Good luck and don't give up. Have a honest conversation.  I have always said one thing to women I have tried to date.  Tell me the good truth, tell me the bad truth, just tell me the truth.  I know I am a big boy and I would rather be hurt a little now than a lot later.  By the way, I am 38, in case you were wondering.   Mike

While the Army is designed for static fighting.  Also depleted uranium has no ill effects.  You will not get cancer by holding it.  It is DEPLETED. That means it is not radioactive.
__label__10 , Does anyone else think that going to war for oil is actually worth it in the long run?,What I mean is, without oil, factories couldn't run, all forms of transportation would grind to a halt, and almost nobody would even be able to heat their homes in the winter. The entire economy and all quality of life would go down the toilet, and would drag the entire world economy down with it. So isn't going to war to secure a steady supply of oil actually worth the cost?,Difficult question you post that could cause many to drop down a knee jerk answer.  First of course everyone will say that human life is of more value than any natural resource.  But think of all the people who'd die of cold in the winter without oil.  And the economics of high priced oil can leave millions out of work and in some really dire circumstances.  However it's the in the long run portion of your question that makes me say that war for oil is not worth it.  The correct thing to do, and I believe this with every fiber in my being, is to find ways around the problem of oil.  Capitalism is suppose to be the perfect system where if a resource is not quite as abundant as one would hope, and therefore more expensive, then the market will find a way around it.  New energies, conservation, etc.  The fact that the powerful in business and politics right now don't want to waste their money researching these things and would rather ride on others backs to fight for cheaper oil is idiotic.  \nOn the bright side, the President mentioned this exact idea in his State of the Union Address.  Whether it was simple lip service or not remains to be seen.

There is also a generalization of factorial in real numbers, and you can also get 0!=1 from the new definition of factorial in real numbers.

She stopped work in July last year & I moved in with her & financially supported her. I also paid for her eldest child to get private education. In January this year my brother was around & I confided in him that she was acting strange & that money was tight. He then ripped into her for being a gold digger when we were all really drunk. She said that she could never forgive me for pouring my heart out to my brother. I work away from home & one time I came back recently & found that she was taking her mobile phone into the toilet & shower with her. I checked her phone & found messages which she claimed were innocent but from her ex. I went back to work & a day later she asked to go on a break. After 5 weeks I asked for decision and she finished it! I love her & want her back. What do I do?,You should probabably give her sometime...because the way it seems is that she either really has feelings for her ex or shes just upset with you and is trying to get back at you...Just give her sometime..and give yourself sometime to find out if shes really what you want and to make sure that u r not just attached

So it's better to know what you want first.
__label__10 , Does anyone here think that Bush is really very charismatic?,Quite frankly, I don't think he's got a lot of charisma. He definitely doesn't have as much as Clinton or Reagan. I remember that when he and Gore were running for the presidency in 2000, it didn't seem that we had any great picks. And not only that, but even after he got to the White House, he didn't seem to stand out in any way. He only began to stand out after the 9/11 attacks. For a while after the attacks, he had the support of a lot of people. However, after he decided to invade Iraq, things began to go in the opposite direction. Either way, the only time he's ever been able to stand out in any way is during a time of conflict. And not only that, but charismatic figures are usually very popular, and since the beginning of the war, he's made himself very unpopular both in the US and elsewhere.,I think you're right.  But he did win with his charm, which I guess is different from charisma.  It's what was called that aw, gosh appeal.  He seemed like a regular guy, in contrast to that over-practiced, slick style of Gore in the 2000 Presidential race.  I think that's why Gore lost to the underdog, Bush.  I think it's the simplest explanation for Bush's victory, since there was no way to judge his fitness for leadership, other than his governorship in Texas, which most Americans knew nothing about.

You can usually get away with being close to those specs if you don't meet them outright, by lowering the levels of eye candy (resolution, anti-aliasing, available features and detail levels, etc.) but the game may simply require more than your video card can provide. In unusual cases a really fast computer can provide some of the capabilities of the graphics card in the CPU, but you'd probably have a fast graphics card to match a fast CPU anyway.\n\nThe 16MB of the video card speaks to how large a texture map it can hold -- the texture map is an image that gets draped over a surface in the game by the video card to make it appear more detailed and complex then it really is. Since your error message says MISSING TEXTURE I'd have to believe it didn't have enough room in the available RAM on the video card to hold the surfaces it needed to apply in the game. Good luck.
__label__10 , How many people are you legally allowed to have living in your 3 bedroom house?,My neighbors are nosy and have contacted the city where I live, they are claiming that I have many unauthorized peoples living at my home. How is it, that the city can inquire about this? If you are not exceeding the building fire codes, can they still tell you to leave town? I have 4 people living in a 3 bedroom home (me and my hubby share a room) my mortgage shows just my husband and myself. I could understand that they might be upset, but does the city really have anything yo do with it? We sometimes have friends and family over, so I think that is why the city inspector was called. We never play music too loud or are purposely annoying to the neighbors.,It depends on the state or local laws, but there usually IS a limit as to how many people can live in one house.  (Although you have certainly not reached it.)\n\nThere are legitimate interests in capping the # of people in a single dwelling, such as # of cars on the street and strain on water/sewage resources, etc.  One notable exception is not limits for any single family, but having too many non-related cohabitants could be a problem.\n\nWith only 4 people though, you are likely not violating any laws, especially b/c it's your house.
__label__2 , What makes the formation of a cloud???,,First you need a parcel of warm moist air. Since warm air is less dense than cold it will rise.\n\nWhen it rises through the troposphere, the air will cool due to something called the adiabatic cooling process. This just means that as air pressure is reduced, the air particles will not be compressed any longer & will cool. \n\nThink of adiabatic temperature change like a bicycle pump. If you keep pumping it, what happens to the cylinder? It gets much warmer. This is b/c you are compressing the air. In the opposite way, w/ certain types of aerosol cans, continuously holding down the nozzle causes the can to cool. This is b/c you are allowing the trapped gases to expand.\n\nWhen the moisture laden air parcel cools to the dew point, water vapor will condense on tiny particulates suspended in the atmosphere. These particles are referred to as condensation nuclei or aerosols. These are usually one of the following: pollen, dust, ash, pollution, salts, etc.\n\nA good way to think of this is an ice cold cola can. On a hot day, moisture from the air surrounding the can will condense on the outside. This is b/c the cold drink inside the can allows the air on the outside to reach the dew point.\n\nOnce condensed on these particles, you have the makings of a cloud!

__label__9 , Women, I like foreplay, but my wife doesn't, do you know why?,My wife used to like foreplay stuff like me going down town and me using my hands and you know all the normal stuff that people do before the do.  Why would she stop liking all that?  We only have sex, and it seems rather mechanical and not very passionate (nothing like it was when we used to make out back in the days.)  I ask her why and she recognizes it but doesn't understand why either.  Could it be psychological or phisiological from maybe new birth control? I can't seem to get her heated up anymore and it was no problem in the past.  We almost have to always use ky and she's hardly ever in the mood. Anybody ever deal with this?  We are both very young in 20s.  What's going on?,She just wants to get to it and get it over with.  Foreplay just prolongs it.
__label__5 , How can I find the physical server location of an Internet domain?,,http://www.arin.net/whois/ is what I use.  Seems to work the best.
__label__2 , Is boiling point increases or decreases inside the pressure cooker when cooked ?,,An increase in pressure causes the boiling point to go up. Think about it like this, at higher pressures, the molecules will be pushed closer together, to the point where intermolecular attractions become significant and the vapor condenses to form a liquid. It takes more energy (i.e. higher temperature) to allow the molecules to break free into the gas phase.\n\nThis is also why the boiling point of water is less at high elevations; there's less pressure, so it's easier to make water boil.\n\nAnother thing to note: The boiling point is defined as the point where the vapor pressure of the substance equals the surrounding pressure. Since vapor pressures generally increase with increasing temperature, an increase in surrounding pressure raises the temperature needed to maintain that equality.
__label__9 , Should I break up with my unemotional boyfriend?,I'm in love with this guy, but he's got issues. He isn't good at verbally or physically expressing his love for me, specially when people is around. First I thought he didn't care for me at all, so I tried to break up with him. But he 'opened' himself to me, and told me about his problems and fears, how much he loves me and cares for me, how his problem had ruined other relationships, but that this is the 1st time he cares enough to try to fix it, that he wants to learn how to show his emotions, to be sweet and romantic, how to make me happy in every way. He asked me to help him and I accepted. Besides the 'expressing' thing, we are great together, we fit together so perfectly.\nBut lately I'm sad all the time, I feel so unloved even if he explained everything to me. I know I should be patient... but right now I'm just depressed. It awful that my friends seem to care for me more than he does. Should I still try with this realtionship? or stop hurting myself because people don't change?,tell him how u feel .. n give him a chance .. i think he's worth it .. many guys know how to express emotions n make us happy but at the end it's all lies .. but some dont know how to make us feel loved but it's still true ..

Is it all about the law, or are somthings just immoral?,Mormon doctrine states that in order to enter the highest heaven that those who enter must be living in polygamy. Mormon doctrine also states that we believe in being subject to the laws of the land, insofar as those laws protect individual rights. So for the time being, the largest Mormon sect, the LDS church, has decided it is more important to live the laws of the land than those of God. Other Mormon faiths have made a different choice in the matter, and practice polygamy in defiance of the unjust laws of the land. \n\nTRUE Mormons will do it whether it's legal or not!!\n\nAnd they do!!!

She thinks he is hiding something because she learned he has in the past)\n\nIt took about a minute, \nTo find the point and hit it, \nGotta take this life and live it, \nCause everything has changed and now… \n\n(It didnt take her long to find the problem and fix it because life is short and you have to live it)\n\nI ain’t gonna look the other way, \nAfter all the clouds go by, \nIt’s just another empty sky, \nI ain’t gonna wait to see the rain, \nNothing’s gonna make it right, \nLook at me cause I choose life, \n\nWhen all the lights go out, \nSo suddenly, I lose my way, \nSo baby tell me, is something goin on, \nYou gotta free me, this time I’m gonna be strong, \n\n(She feels clueless when he doesn't tell her whats going on.

__label__9 , I need good advice?,I have a problem. I am in love with a girl who I have dated off and on for 2 years. I really loves her but she is dating a guy named Ian. She loves Me and Ian both but she doesn't know which one to date and we hate each other guts but are nice to each other just top make her happy. She says that i am loving caring but that sometimes she feel i don't care what she is talking bout but i really do. Ian is loving and caring and he show more emotion in public and stuff but sometimes takes it too far and when me and her are alone we do some stuff but not as much in public. I told her I would change that but I don't think she believes me. I need your advise for her and me both. Who should she date? What should I do to get here to like me more?,as for you, i think you should just relax for a little bit. maybe start hanging out with some new girls and just put the first girl on the backburner. this will help you in that you won't be so tied up in it all the time, and it will also help her because it will give her a chance to figure some stuff out. more importantly, she will see what she's missing if you two hang out less. this will likely make you much more attractive to her. or, worst case scenario, she'll pick ian. (which is unlikely) but if she does, then obviously the relationship wouldn't have worked anyway. moral of the story: give the relationship a little breathing room and cross your fingers. good luck!

__label__1 , what did Napoleon do in 1799?,french Revolution,In 1799, the French armies under Napoleon were camped outside of Acre. Napoleon issued a letter offering Palestine as a homeland to the Jews under French protection. The project was stillborn because Napoleon was defeated and was forced to withdraw from the Near East. The letter is remarkable because it marks the coming of age of enlightenment philosophy, making it respectable at last to integrate Jews as equal citizens in Europe and because it marked the beginning of nineteenth century projects for Jewish autonomy in Palestine under a colonial protectorate. After the defeat of Napoleon, it was largely the British who carried forward these projects, which have in hindsight been given the somewhat misleading name of British Zionism.

I am especially interested in hearing from you victims of Catholic School.,yes, during the formative years i think it is a good idea; people just simply need a good a$$-whoopin sometimes, as long as it is within reason and the rules have been clearly laid out for them. a teacher i knew in 7th grade used to paddle someone once a week and i didn't see anyone reacting in any way but with respect and just plain fear. as people grow older i think the whole corporal punishment idea should be used only in certain circumstances. there is nothing like unjust punishment or retribution for actions within one's own prerogative to make you extremely pissed off and seek vengeance. if a cop ever told me to bend over and assume the position i'd either start laughing or take his fukin badge.

The closest we can get to complete randomness is a hardware pseudorandom process (see second and third link).

One more thing, I heard that it is also an immunity disease, does that mean you are more prone to colds and stuff also?  It seems like I get sick alot more than i used to.,Contact the Center for Endometriosis Care at www.centerforendo.com.  They perform surgical excision, which is shown to be 85% effective for long-term relief, versus superficial surgical treatments like ablation, fulguration, vaporization, etc.  The key to treating the disease is to truly remove it all.  Endo has an autoimmune component, which you can learn more about from the Endo Research Center at www.endocenter.org.  They also have a discussion group at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/erc which you might benefit from.  Good luck and remember you don't have to suffer.  You're not alone!

__label__6 , who many nations in the  world cup?,,32
__label__6 , convert rpm to mph?,,You need to know the gear ratio in the transmission and the final drive ratio.  Here is an example:\n\n32 diameter tire spins 32*3.14159=100.5 per turn, or 8.38 feet per turn.  Say the engine is spinning at 2100 RPM in overdrive.  Overdrive on my car is 0.74 (as showin in specifications for transmission.)  My Final Drive ratio is 3.73:1.  So every time the propeller shaft turns 3.73 times, the tire spins one time.\n\n2100 engine RPM * 1/0.74 * 1/3.73=760 wheel RPM.  So the engine speed is first increased by the overdrive, then reduced by the final drive.  The wheel spinning at 760 RPM will give 8.38 Feet * 760 = 6369 feet per minute. Multiply by 60 to get 382128 feet per hour.  Now, in one mile there are 5280 feet.  So 382128 feet/hr * 1/5280 feet/mile = 72 MPH.  NOTE: numbers have been rounded off.\n\nOOOPS--for a bicycle wheel do the following:\ntake the diameter of the wheel, multiply by Pi.  \n26 wheel * 3.14159/12 = 6.8 feet per turn.  If the wheel is spinning at 380 RPM, then at 6.8feet/turn = 2584 feet per minute * 60 = 155040 feet per hour *1/5280 feet/mile = 29 MPH.
__label__7 , to which career should i incline.i study hard but the resuls are not up to the mark?,i was born on 08-08-1992 at 5.15pm.,You are very young.  There is plenty of time for you to develop a skill that does not rely heavily on academic subjects.\n\nDo you have any hobbies?  Almost any hobby can lead to a career, if you think creatively about it.  If you have any talent for music or art or athletics, there are careers in those fields.  Do you make things?  Could you develop a skill there, and become a master craftsman or related professional?  Do you have a good eye for a bargain, and could make your way as a buyer for a shop?  There are thousands of careers that do not rely on an academic degree, and the advantage is you get to start earlier than those who must slog through four years of college.  \n\nYou need to be able to assess your strengths and weaknesses, your likes and dislikes, as honestly as possible.  I strongly recommend you get a copy of What Color is Your Parachute? to do this self-analysis.  A second-hand one will do, as it does not need to be the most current one.  You are too young to be actively seeking employment yet.  But it will get you thinking about what you can do, and channel your energies into developing what you do best.\n\nGood luck!  And if you find you are a competent sculptor or designer, and start making dolls for a living, let me know.  I'd love to be one of your first customers!

__label__6 , Can you people help me come up with a badass name for a football team, must be plural?,just a name that sounds totally badass not necesarily cool but badass please and thankyou,The Wolverine's\n\nWe are noted for the following traits: \n\nStanding Our Ground \nFierceness \nElusiveness \nCleverness \nStrength \nEndurance \nCourage \n\nReal wolverines are so badass the football team can't even have the real ones on the side line in cages \n\nIn 1927, 10 wolverines were obtained from Alaska and placed in the Detroit Zoo. On big football days, two of these wolverines were brought to Michigan Stadium and carried around in cages. \nHowever, the animals grew larger and more ferocious, and as Yost states,  It was obvious that Michigan mascots had designs on the Michigan men toting them, and those designs were no means friendly. Therefore the practice of bring wolverines into the stadium had to be discontinued after only one year. However, one of the wolverines was not returned to the zoo. Instead Biff was put in a cage at the University of Michigan Zoo where students were able to visit him at times. In 1937, the Chevrolet Motor Company donated a wolverine (as well as a cage to keep it in), to the University of Michigan. It was unclear how long this wolverine lasted, but it is known that no live wolverines have been in the stadium in the last half century. \n\n\nIf a Wolverine was the size of a bear it would be the strongest animal on the planet.\n\nI know what you should absolutely not name your football team\n\nThe Spartans.... Sparta was the queen the ancient city was named after, her husband was the name of the whole territory. Do you really want to be thought of as someones little sister?...lol

__label__9 , What are your best tips for keeping the passion alive in a long, long, LONG term relationship?,,Ok, I had been with my old man for 15 years, so I might have some ideas for you. \n\nDon't get into a routine if you can help it (Sex only on Sat night. that kind of thing).Be spotanious, and try differnt times of day, differnt places in the house (not just the bed) differnt places (the car, the beach, the pool or jacccuzzi). \n\nAlso add toys, DVD's (make them or buy them), and flavored body gels &oils. Have fun with food, fruit, honey, syrup...use you imagination.\n\nAlso take time every once in a while to get real romantic foe no particular occasion, go all out, get your hair & nails done, buy new lingerie & set the mood with candles, music and flowers. \n\nRole playing can be fun too, go to local bar, have him go there too and pretend like you are meeting each other for the first time. Either you pick him up, or have him pick you up. Ask questions like you really don't know everything about each other you might discover something new! \n\nOh, this is a good one too, send him sexy or romantic emails at work (if he won't get in trouble), or leave sexy messages on his cell phone voice mail. Also you can put sexy notes or photos in his briefcase, so he finds them when he least expects it. \n\nHave flowers delivered to his office just to say 'I love you, but not for any special occasion. \n  \nAnd most importantly, especially if you have kids make sure that you go on dates and make time for each other outside the house. Also make time when you send the kids away and have the house to yourself so you can run around naked all day!! We always would trade weekends with other couples who had kids so we would watch their kids one weekend, and they would watch our one weekend. It’s cool because you don't have to spend money on a sitter (use it for your date instead), and you help out another couple who probably needs a break from the kids as much as you do! \n\nAlso, this is my best passion saving tip I can give you...No matter what every year take a vacation with just your hunny, no kids, no relative house, even if it is only for 1 or 2 nights. Go to an exotic location or just a nice hotel in the city closest to you. This will do more to help you remember why you feel in love and ignite passion in your relationship. No one is too busy or too broke to find 1 night a year to do something really special!! \n\nI want to let you know that if you start to do some of this stuff, let him know you expect to be pampered also and challenge him to surprise you with romance also. Make it a fun game you can both play and you will both come out winners!! \n \nI hope this helps you!

__label__2 , A website where i can get a free online book on pipeline engineering?,A website on free online book on pipeline engineering? Most of the sites I have seen requires the book on pipeline engineering to be bought,Send your resume to your future employer of choice, make a promise to give them first choice to hire, and ask them if they will buy your book and if they have any work-study program that gives you employment during summer and/or vacations.\n\nBasically, I think you are dreaming about getting some book like this for free without some exchange of value.\n\nLearn to use the library better, and they can also get a loan of rare books from other libraries (don't lose them!!!) or may consider your recommendation for references, especially if endorsed by faculty and other students.
__label__4 , Why heart?,Theres different phrases using heart like you have heart and love comes from the heart\n\nWhere did this all begin with heart meaning these things?,I found some pretty neat sites that talk about the history of the heart's symbology. \n\nThe heart we know has been used for years, since the Ice Age, as a symbol, because it loosely resembles the human heart. It was related to the attirbute of Eros, the god of sexuality, thus some of its romantic connotations. \n\nThe best of the websites is the second one. It has a TON of information on the cultural history of the heart. If you go to Culture --> Civilization, you'll get info like this:\n\n  All of the ancient cultures shared one trait in common in how they perceived the heart. They thought that the heart was the center of emotion. The Egyptians, for instance, thought the heart to be the most important organ. They would embalm bodies by removing the organs and placing them in ceramic containers to be buried with the body. However, the heart would be the only organ left in the body. They felt the heart played an important role in the afterlife. As legend has it, if the heart (representing conscience) weighs less than the feather (representing truth) then the person will be allowed to live in the afterlife. The Egyptians thought the heart generated thought and emotion. They had no conception of the mind (brain). \n\n    Along with the Egyptians, the ancient Greeks thought the soul was associated with the heart as well.  The Greeks found that the heart was even more firm than the liver, and therefore, they interpreted this to mean that it had great significance in the human life.\n\nThe word, lev (meaning “heart” in Hebrew) is found 190 times in the Jewish bible. It is always understood that emotional and spiritual behavior is associated with the heart.\n\nHope that helps!

__label__2 , try this one..?,a sales man has a guaranteed salary minimum of 1500/month. he is paid a 20% commision on all sales what is his pay in a month where sales are 6550. can some one show me the formula as well,s = sales\nc = commision\n\nc = s * (20/100) = .20s\n\nSo if you mean that he gets a base salary of $1,500 PLUS whatever he earns in commision, then\n\nPay = 1500 + .20s\n\nIf you mean that he gets paid 20% commision, and if the commision isn't at least 1500, then he gets 1500, then\n\nPay = 1500 OR .20s  , whichever is higher.\n\n\nIn this case, his commision (c) is\nc = .20 * 6550\nc = 1310\n\nSo his pay is either $1,500 (since 1310 is less than 1500) or $2,810 (1310+1500) depending one which your looking for. The phrasing of your question leaves doubt as to which you're looking for.

__label__2 , Is the PPh2 anion in KPPh2 a hard, soft or borderline base? Please give your basis. I need to know this badly.,I want to introduce the PPh2 group to my system, a Zr oxide cluster with dangling alkyl bromide groups. I don't know whether the PPh2 anion from KPPh2 attacks the Zr cluster or replaces the bromides. I'm trying to use the HSAB concept as a guide.,I think it's safe to say that PPh2 is soft, considering it has a phosphorus central atom with 2 benzene rings. The defining characteristic is that the molecule has a diffuse electron cloud, caused by the delocalized pi system in the benzene rings as well as the size of the phosphorus electron cloud.\n\nAs to your reaction, I'm not sure.

__label__4 , why balkan is the powder keg of world war 1?,,I think you mean the Balkans, not balkan.\n\nHere is a little background on the start of World War I:\n\nOn June 28, 1914, Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary was assassinated. He was murdered at Sarajevo, the capital of the Austrian province of Bosnia. The assassin was Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian-trained Bosnian terrorist. Austria claimed that Serbian government officials had trained and equipped Princip's group, which was known as the Black Hand. For many years Serbia and Austria-Hungary had been unfriendly because Serbian nationalists wanted to unite all Slavic peoples living in the Balkan region into a single state. Slavs living in Austria-Hungary would be included, and Austria-Hungary strongly opposed this.\n\nSo, as you can see, the Balkan region is where the tensions of the Bosnians and Serbs ignited the war. They called upon their allies and World War I began.
__label__5 , Computer mouse problem, help?,Everytime I click on something once [like Internet Explorer in the Start menu or folders in my desktop] a new menu opens up with the 'open, run as...' options.  How do I make this stop? [I use the left clicker to open things, etc].,A menu like that pops up when you click the RIGHT button under normal circumstances.  What happens when you click the button on the right side?  Does your icon turn blue?  If you double-click the right button, does IE open up?\n\nIf so, you can fix this by going into your computer's Control Panel. Click on START and Control Panel should be on the right-hand side of the menu (if not, click on START using the other mouse button).\n\nFrom here, it depends on your operating system.  You might see an icon called mouse, or you might see printers and other hardware - if so, click this, and then you'll see one called mouse.  Double click mouse.  Move to the properties tab if you are not already there.  Then under button configuration, see if the box before switch primary and secondary buttons  is checked.  If it is, uncheck this box, and it should return everything to normal.\n\nIf this doesn't help, I would go to the Website of the company who manufactured your mouse.  They usually have tips for troubleshooting problems like yours.\n\nI hope this helps.  Try it and see.

__label__6 , is judo a good form of martial arts to learn for fitness?,,I think the answer to this question depends on the type of dojo you train at. I trained in judo and at my dojo, the first hour was nothing but cardio drills, footwork, push ups, abdominal work with medicine balls, calisthenics, stretching,etc. Then the next hour was actual Judo where we learned techniques with repositioning, throws (Tachi waza) as well as ground fighting (Ne waza), pins, joint locks, arm bars,etc. Even the second hour was tough because it takes energy to grapple. That was my school. Other judo schools, you will just see a bunch of fat guys standing around working on throws and what not. But overall, I think Judo is great for fitness.

__label__1 , Why do so many people use apostrophies when they are not necessary?,For example, SUVs is correct.  Not SUV's.  Also, it's means it is.  The possessive form is its.,I agree with you 100%.  But dollhaus is correct about SUV's - I remember learning it that way in the 1980s.  Also for numbers - 80's and 90's, as well as 80s and 90s, have both been considered correct at one time or another.  But what really irritates me the most are the apostrophe's used for plural's.  That just looks incredibly ignorant!  It gets confusing, too, when people use them for their plurals but not their possessives.  The boy's played with the dogs toy's today.  This book is hers'.  I knew someone who did this a lot.  I just hate reading things like that, because I usually end up having to read it a couple of times to make sure I understood it correctly.  \n\nI had a manager one time who completely understood - he compared it to someone who was musically inclined hearing a note that was out of tune.  A grammatical error stands out to some people the way a sour note stands out to others.  I am definitely one of the former.  Not to say that I don't make errors myself, but I try to correct them as I go.  A lot of people just don't care to make the effort.\n\nAnother thing that really irritated me - on one of my son's computer games, it uses it's instead of its.  These games are supposed to be designed to teach children, not promote ignorance!

__label__7 , Who has been succesful starting their own business and how?,,There are so many how's  boy oh boy... One thing I can say is that you have to have patience.  You have to have it in your mind that you will work with it through the profitless times.  \n\nYou will need to have a real job in the mean time.  Because your bills will still keep coming even though your income won't. a huge percent of start up business lose money in the beginning. They say that the majority of them go under within the first 5 years.  If you can make it past that point you have a shot at keeping it going and actually haveing it be profitable.  I have my own business and It took about 2 (TWO) years before I got my FIRST order!!  I have now been in business for about 5 years and making money.  If I wanted to I could even have enough to do in order to hire employees.  But it took time.  \n\nThe second most important thing  - I must stress this - it is VERY important - YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING THAT OTHERS WANT.   Wether it is a service or a product... if others don't want it you will NOT make a penny.  \n\nGood luck with it!!

__label__2 , If time slows when nearing the speed of light would light think it took less than a year to go 1 light year?,I'm puzzled by the time paradox of near-light-speed travel. If time would seem to pass more slowly to a high-speed traveller, why wouldn't it also seem to pass more slowly from the perspective of light, itself? In other words, why do we say that it takes light a year to travel a light year? To us, perhaps, it does, but from the light's perspective, wouldn't it take much less time to go that distance, or even no time at all? And, if not, why not?,if you were traveling at the speed of light, which would basically make you light itself, time would never pass and you would be unaware of the concept of time.  \nwhen you talk about the light year, that's a measurement of distance- the distance that something traveling at 180,000 miles per second goes in a year.  i know that it's confusing, because then you get into the concepts of proper and coordinate time, and proper and coordinate distance.\nbasically, if you are traveling at exactly the speed of light, which you cannot do, from your perspective it would take no time to travel anywhere, and therefore you would travel no distance.  it's pretty freaky stuff.\nwe look at it a different way because we have a different perspective and travel at a different speed.\ngosh i love relativity.

A single electron passes its energy to nearby electron. this way lightning moves, so it cud be not a straight line but a curve path also as electrons can transfer energy to other electrons in any direction. so sometimes its zigzag pattern also.

Who would you save and why?\nYour own child?\nYour neighbors child?\nThe child of an illegal immigrant?\nIn essence this is what we face both in life as well as in schools of American today.

__label__4 , What should I do?,I don't feel that college is for me, but I kinda feel obligated to go. What I really want to do is sing and write books, but everyone is telling me I need a back up plan. Isn't having a back up plan like not having faith in your abilities or is it just common sense? I'm really lost on the issue and keep going back and forth on what to do. I would really appreciate any opinions on the matter.,Absolutely get a degree that will help you in the world of work.  No matter how talented you are, until you have made a reputation and begun earning in the Arts, you will require food, a place to live, clothes, travel money, etc.  Such expenses are not paid for by your potential as a great artist.  The days where a wealthy patron would support you as you honed your craft are practically gone.  Not only that, but taking courses in college on how to get your writing sellable will make a big difference.  I would suggest aiming for a job in the publishing world so that you will know what an author goes through to sell their work.  Besides, reading great literature in college and learning what goes into it will not be lost on you.  Best of luck.
__label__10 , Since human cause global warming because of ever expanding population and consumption?,Do you support subjecting  countries who do not control their pollution &population to sanctions?,Humans are a very small cost of global warming.  Anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere only account for 4% of all greenhouse gases.  If you look at graphs scientists make up of the temperature over the past 100,000,000 years you can see that we are just at another warm period in our earths history.  There has been warmer times before.  I don't really know how the scientists can figure out what the temperature was 100,000,000 years ago but i have a graph in my environmental science text book that shows that they have.

I like this guy and i think he likes me too but he doesn't know i like him so how am i supposed to tell him that i like him more than a friend??!!,I don't know how old you are, but try to hangout with the guy: maybe work on homework together or invite him and his friends to hang out with you and your friends. Pay attention to him but be cool about it-NO tripping, getting over-excited or stalking or acting obsessed. If he gets the clue and tells you he likes you-mission accomplished! If he seems interested but you get the feeling he is too shy to admit he likes you then just casually ask him to hangout, just the two of you this time. If he doesn't seem interested play it cool and let it slide, you don't want to lose a friend and besides there are plenty of guys out there who would like a thoughtful girl like you. Good luck!!!
__label__2 , im confused, why is there never a 100% yield in chemistry?,,all reactions are going both ways.  for instance, H2 + O2--->H2O ( I know it's not balanced) also goes from H2O---->H2 + O2.  A 100% yield is never acheived because the reaction reaches a state of equilibrium where the reactants are going from H2 + O2--->H2O just as fast as they are going from H2O--->H2 + O2.\n\nAn entire semester of inorganic chemistry is devoted to the concept of equalibrium.

__label__2 , what causes muscle cramping after rigorous exercise?,,Muscle fibers have long proteins called actin that are disposed as railways and form a long chain al along the muscle. \nA second protein, miosin, has a movable head that crawls up the actin, gragging a limited amount of muscle mass with it. The movement of millions of these proteins produces the contraction of the muscle.\nFor this, muscles need two things: Calcium that allows the miosin head to glue to the actin, and ATP (an energy carrier molecule that is produced by the cellular respiration) that gives it the energy to move one step and be dettached for a new cycle.\nWhen exercising a lot, you might consume all of the cellular oxygen or the glucose (the sugar from which cells extract the enrgy). This means a drop in ATP levels. So theres is calcium, the miosin attaches itself to the actin, but cannot move. This means the muscle gets cramped. This is the explanation for Rigor mortis too.\nThe cramps that occurr by dehidration or lack of salts (including calcium) don't have to do with muscular function. Rather, they stimulate the excitability of the nerves that tell the muscle to contract, so they might spontaneusly and continously produce this state, called tetanus (with equal or very similar symptoms to cramps).\nThe lactic acid acumulation someone told you about earlyer is not a cramp. It rather produces the pain you feel AFTER you exercise and rest your muscle, because this is a very insoluble compound that forms abrsive cristals inside your muscle cells, which are very painfull when you move it. Beware of them, because the more painfull it is, the bigger the cellular damage is. And muscle cells are not that easily replaced. If you feel this pain, try not to force the sore muscle.\nThe cramp and the lactic acid acumulation (don't know the word, in spanish it is agujeta) have, however, teh same origin: An exercise too strong that consumes more energy than the muscular cell can produce by respiration (there's not enough oxygen in the cell to ope with the demand). So if you get a cramp during exercise, very likely you'll get Agujetas the next day.
__label__7 , What are the chances that prices on land in the Florida Panhandle will fall?,There's obviously been a decrease in demand in real estate lately.  Toll Brothers, St.Joe, etc have seen drops in orders, and people actually backing out of contracts.  I'm looking to buy a single lot in Walton County to build on later down the road.  Prices have jumped to outrageous levels, and in my opinion, more than demand warrants over the last few years.  Any chance there will be a decrease into a more reasonable range in the next year or so?,I think that the housing market across the USA is overpriced and that prices will have to go down soon.  I think that the prime rate is going to go up to try to stem inflation  and that will decrease the demand on housing.  You also have the high fuel costs and people may not want to be buying new houses because of the costs of transportation.  On the other side, if the panhandle is anything like here, in Texas, there are fewer housing starts taking place here because most of the contractors are in New Orleans to help reconstruct the city there.  That causes there to be higher demand and fewer new homes being produced.

__label__2 , what is quantum mechanics?,,quantum mechanics is a fundamental branch of theoretical physics that replaces classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism at the atomic and subatomic levels. It is the underlying mathematical framework of many fields of physics and chemistry, including condensed matter physics, atomic physics, molecular physics, computational chemistry, quantum chemistry, particle physics, and nuclear physics. Along with general relativity, quantum mechanics is one of the pillars of modern physic\n    \n\nThe term quantum (Latin, how much) refers to discrete units that the theory assigns to certain physical quantities, such as the energy of an atom at rest (see Figure 1, at right). The discovery that waves could be measured in particle-like small packets of energy called quanta led to the branch of physics that deals with atomic and subatomic systems which we today call Quantum Mechanics. The foundations of quantum mechanics were established during the first half of the twentieth century by Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck, Louis de Broglie, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Max Born, John von Neumann, Paul Dirac, Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli and others. Some fundamental aspects of the theory are still actively studied.\n\nQuantum mechanics is a more fundamental theory than Newtonian mechanics and classical electromagnetism, in the sense that it provides accurate and precise descriptions for many phenomena that these classical theories simply cannot explain on the atomic and subatomic level. It is necessary to use quantum mechanics to understand the behavior of systems at atomic length scales and smaller. For example, if Newtonian mechanics governed the workings of an atom, electrons would rapidly travel towards and collide with the nucleus. However, in the natural world the electron normally remains in a stable orbit around a nucleus — seemingly defying classical electromagnetism.\n\nQuantum mechanics was initially developed to explain the atom, especially the spectra of light emitted by different atomic species. The quantum theory of the atom developed as an explanation for the electron's staying in its orbital, which could not be explained by Newton's laws of motion and by classical electromagnetism.\nhope this helps u out....\nhave a great day......

__label__2 , how can we increase our brain power and memmory?,What is our brain memmory?\nHow can we boost it up?\n&\nThe capacity of our brain.,Lately you find that you have a problem remembering, such things as a person’s name and the date that events are held on. You would like to improve your memory, but you don’t know where to begin to accomplish a greater memory. \n\n\nDifferent parts of the brain, handle different types of remembering tasks, such as recalling a person’s phone number versus remembering a person’s car. \n\nPeople tend to remember things differently through the use of dreferential senses, which means seeing something versuses hearing it. \n\nThis approach acknowledges, that specific memory stategies, are appropriate for different memory tasks. Memory strategies must be talented, to meet the individual’s memory needs. \n\nThis approach also recognizes that memory can be affected by many factors, including cognitive, which involves knowledge about memory strategies and some non-cognitive, which deals with such \n\nthings as overall fitness, mood and health. \n\n\nThere’s a method of memory called the Holistic view of memory. This approach is based on the concept of an individual’s memory readiness. \n\n\nScientists and health-care say that memory readiness can be improved, with a person’s attitude physical condition, their \n\nemotional state, conversational skills and the use of physical memory aids. These aids can be used in improving practical memory performance. \n\n\nTests have shown that monentary memory can vary at particular times, which can happen during the course of the day, course of the week or month. \n\n\nPeople tend to believe that their memory skills, are poorer than they really are. \n\n\nImproving your memory can be done at anytime. It doesn’t matter if your young, old, brilliant or average. Your memory can still be improved to remember better. \n\n\nThere’s no magic pill that can be taken to improve ones memory. To improve one’s memory, a person has to access the state of various memory abilities and then this adds to a person’s memory \n\nskills one at a time. \n\n\nSometimes if a person is stressed or has a cold their memory can be affected. Some nutritionists believe that vitamins help improve memory. \n\n\nThere are various memory techniques, that a person can do to improve their memory. \n\n\nOne method is the mnemonics method. This method is used for remembering information, that’s otherwise quite difficult to recall. The principle of mnemonics, is to use as many of the \n\nbest functions of the human brain, as possible to code information into the memory. The mnemonics method uses the human brain that’s used to code and interpret complex stimuli-images, colour, structure, sounds, smells, tastes, touch, emotion and languages. The brain uses these to make sophisticated interpretations, of the environment. These features are what the \n\nhuman memory is made of. \n\n\nInformation presented to the brain to be remembered,is all from one source, which is normally words on a page. Language or words \n\non a page reflects, are of the most important aspect of the human evolution. Mnemonics seeks to use all of these resources, by coding the language and the numbers in sophisticated striking \n\nimages, which flow into stronger images then are actually coded. Both information and structure of the information which is, to be recalled later. This method is simple and easy to understand. Remembering names is important, but such things as remembering, a pack of cards is just an amusing sideline. \n\n\nWhen remembering a person’s name, you can improve memory by using face association. With this technique, when you are introduced to a person examine the person’s face. Find an unusual ffeature of the person’s face. Create an association with the person’s face and the name will be in your memory. Also use repetition \n\nwhen being introduced, ask for the name to be repeated, use the name yourself, as much as possible. The more you hear the person’s name, the more the name will sink in your memory. \n\n\nW

__label__1 , Why do so many people need to do illegal drugs?  Is it the thrill?  Is it suicide?,,I believe that people do drugs because they can't face reality.  alot of young people do it because it was introduced to them by a friend. However, a strong teen, can refuse it I believe that alot of it is what the parents instill in them. however, when it comes to an adult, the only reason I can possibly think of is stupidity. I'm sure that alot of them have personal problems,  it is a way to destroy your body, family, children, and everything areound you. so when someone does drugs they affect everyone, not just their selves.

What do you think of his pitching capabilities against MLB sluggers?,I can only see success for him.

He has some filthy stuff and I will draft him on several fantasy leagues next year.
__label__1 , Have you ever heard of the word pedastry? Please read source below before asnwering?,Please give your thoughts on this  in brief please.\n\nSource: http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/sirrobhitch.suffolk/Portland%20State%20University%20Greek%20Civilization%20Home%20Page%20v2/docs/10/elinii.html,Yes, I had heard of the word pedarasty.  The source you list is consistant with other information about sexual practices in Ancient Greece.\n\nSimilar things were practiced in other cultures too - Japan, for example.\n\nThese days, even if consenting, such relationships are illegal in most jurisdictions.\n\nThe term pederasty embraces a wide range of erotic relations between adult males and adolescent boys. Pederastic relations can have widely dissimilar manifestations – they can be lawful or transgressive, chaste or sexual, loving or commercial – and have been documented from prehistory to modern times.\nPederasty derives from the combination of pais (παις) (Greek for 'boy') with erastis (Greek for 'lover'; cf. eros). Late Latin pæderasta was borrowed in the sixteenth century directly from Plato’s classical Greek in The Symposium. The word first appears in the English language in the Renaissance, as pæderastie (e.g.: in Samuel Purchas' Pilgrimage.), in the sense of sexual relations between men and boys.\n\nIn modern academic parlance, pederasty is used as a generic term to describe the cultural phenomenon of love relationships between men and adolescent boys, wherever encountered.\n\nThe main difference between pedarasty and pedophilia (from the perspective of academia) is that pedophilia is a fetish - pedophiles only are aroused by children (of either sex, not just boys), where as pedarasts might not only be attracted to young boys, and the attraction is not necessarily sexual.  The word pedarast specifically refers to boys.

__label__8 , What are some really good christian artists?,,Just looking at your name, K-Dogg, you are probably into hip-hop.  My husband and I really like the underground Christian hip-hop.  Flame is in my cd player now, but others that come to mind are: xross, Prime Minister (his latest with his wife on it), T.H.I.S. Click Records, 3 the God Way, Canton Jones, Toby Mac, Thousand Foot Crutch, Platinum Souls, Manifesto, Grits, Holy Hit Makerz, KJ-52, John Rueben, Lecrae, Mr. Del, Lil iRocc, Verbs, Cross Movement, Kirk Franklin, Apple Jaxx, Romio no E, L.A. Symphony, Shei Atkins, Travy Joe, Mista and Mrs. Taylor, Probly Pablo, DJ Maj, Out of Eden, Tonex, Mynista, Y.N.G. Souljah, Mars Ill, and Papa San to name a few that we like.  \n\nThere are tons of places to buy music like this online if you don't have a Christian bookstore near you that has a good stock of hip-hop.  Some places that we go are:\n www.bus-shop.com\nwww.musicforce.com\nwww.cdbaby.com\nwww.musicchristian.com\n\nEven with Christian hip-hop, you have to check the lyrics.  If the words and actions of the artist are shady, you don't want to be hearing false preachers.  We like music in other genres, too.  Out of all of the ones listed, I would say that my personal favorites at this time are Canton Jones, Out of Eden, Toby Mac, Flame, Probly Pablo, and Manifesto.

The car I was in flipped over, I think they said 2 or 3 times and we ended up in a ditch. The ditch was pretty full with water runoff from melting snow so the car was coming in the windows. I had to sit in a sit up position for like 2 hours until someone found us. That experience also gave me my first look at death. My uncle was decapitated by the roof. The roof peeled back as we rolled down the enbankment.

Did you know most problems with breast feeding aren't really problems at all? Who thinks breastfeeding moms need more support? How many breastfeeding mom's quit before they were ready due to lack of support and knowledge? Let's speak up on this issue. Especially if you are in the US where breasfeeding is still so taboo compared with the rest of this great earth.,Breast feeding is so easy.  No bottles and no mess.  And for all those who think a nursing mom needs to excuse herself to the restroom for this activity, I ask Do you eat your lunch in a bathroom?  Neither does my baby.  \n\nIf you breastfeed and your baby is still always hungry, pump about five minutes, then nurse.  The first few ounces of breast milk are watery; the richer more filling milk takes a bit to come in.

I don't necessarily need to watch on my DVD player (even though that would be nice) but Media Player will work too.  Thanks.,The Microsoft Movie Maker (Built into XP) can probably get that down to size for you.  But a file that large will take a lot of time to compress to another type of file.  But to actually burn it to a DVD and watch it on a normal DVD Player (not PC in other words) You'll have to use a different piece of software.  I use Roxio's Easy Media Creator Home myself.  But if you do some searches on Google or Yahoo you might find something to your liking.  As for how to actuall acomplish your task with Roxio or Movie Maker.. you'll just have to read the tutorials in Movie Maker or the Manual of Roxio or whatever software you choose.

In fact, they are herbal and thus not evaluated by the FDA.\nBy the way, speaking as a 53 year old guy, I can tell you that with most women, size doesnt matter. In fact, one woman I talked to told me her husband was hung like a horse and she hadnt had an orgasm in months. It's not the size of the boat, but the motion of the ocean.
__label__9 , Are we dating for the right reasons?,I find that people date to meet people that will make them happy. Is it even possible that someone can make you happy? I'm thinking that it's not. Wouldn't it be more realistic to meet someone who you feel comfortable with enough to allow your unhappiness to come out so it can be healed? People pair off, and when their unhappiness comes out they blame the partner. Will people ever realize that relationships are not designed to make you happy, but is in fact a spiritual partnership designed to make you whole with time?\nI also believe that you attract into your life people that are on the same level of consciousness as you are, whether you see it or not. So if you want good, positive people in your life, shouldn't you be that first? What are your thoughts?,I agree with most of your sentiments.  I think that, as unpalatable as we Westerners have found arranged marriages, all things equal, relationships last longer and are ultimately more fulfilling when they are begun based upon substantial commonalities (religion, socioeconomic status and goals, philosophical approaches to life, and other deep aspects of personhood).  I have never had a relationship last or be very satisfying when it was begun based upon physical or sexual attraction, the potential for some gain, or because others thought we would be good together or should marry.\nI also do not feel that even the best relationship is likely to overcome the most profoundly hurt and unhappy people's disenchantment with life.  However, once one has begun to find her own happiness, the right partner can certainly accentuate an already positive life.  It is those relationships for which we should strive; and for no less than that should we settle.

I opted to have it cut out, and yes, it hurt badly for about a week.

__label__4 , how do I get the sex e-mails to stop coming in my bulk file without opening every one?,,My suggestion is to simply never open anything with a sender you do not know.  I just take a quick run through and then dump all of the bulk files.  That's the purpose/benefit of it going to bulk...  after I started coming onto Yahoo answers I started getting 50 to 100 more trash emails a day... there's not really much you can do about it.

__label__10 , Why do they wait so long to carry out the Death Penalty Sentence?,Something seems really wrong about that!\nhttp://www.dpio.org/inmates/Sellers,_Sean.html,Wow...what a mind provoking question!\n\nI read the article, and one thing that crossed my mind was.. Why didn't this kid get recognition of having an anger problem before he committed murders? Was mom turning a blind eye in love or denying that anything was wrong, that he was just a teen misbehaving? (I'm not speaking poorly of the dead, just a thought in observation) Now that's just my first thought because I see things happen everyday with youth that is ignored until it explodes.. and everyone wonders why? The old adage of An ounce of preventions is worth a pound of cure comes to mind. (Again not trying to intend disrespect to anyoness views of this situation)\n\nBut excuses are just that excuses...you break the law you have to pay for it. Why do we support waiting to carry out the final death penalty?...because we study the case .. use it for profiling ...what made the crime occur, if there was a prevention available, if this person actually did the crime, and to see if any forensic studies can prove them innocent even if the jury has found them guilty.\n\nMy personal opinion...If it's caught on tape and undeniable that this person is guilty and deserving of the death penalty.. it should be done within a month TOPS!! Unfortunately the wheels of justice turn way too slowly.

__label__2 , whats the prime factorization of 100?,,Divide 100 into 2 numbers, for instance 50 and 2. Write those down. 2 is a prime number, so cannot be divided further. Divide 50 into 2 numbers. Write down all the prime numbers you have. You should end up with 5 x 5 x 2 x 2 for your final answer. If you multiply these prime numbers together, you get 100! Do similar problems the same way.

__label__6 , Does lifting weights when ur 13 years old stunt your growth?,,Here you go this should help:\n\nThe whole notion of growth being stunted by weight lifting is a myth. It didn't stunt the growth of Shaquille O'Neal, David Robinson, Karl Malone, Michael Vick, etc. They all started lifting in their early teens, and all have gone on to be well over 6' tall and star in professional sports. \n\nDave Draper and Arnold Schwarzenegger started lifting very \nyoung and both are 6'1 or taller. Lou Ferrigno started \nworking out at 14 years old at the height of 5' 9 and grew to 6' 5 - taller then anyone in his family!\n\nSo the answer is no, weightlifting does not stunt height growth, or any other kind of growth, for that matter. There is no scientific evidence to support such ideas and, in fact, books such as the Russian, School of Height, suggest that weight training may stimulate growth. The latest weight training studies done on teens showed only positive effects. \n\nI'd also point out that activities such as running and jumping create forces on the body that are six to eight times one's body weight. The compression forces on his legs and spine are far greater in running and jumping than they will ever be in squatting or pressing over head. \n\nNot only will proper weight training not stunt growth, it allows teens to grow up with stronger muscles and bones, along with a healthy lifestyle. It certainly benefits any other sport they engage in.
__label__3 , Getting wisdom teeth out friday and im scared...?,hey all, i get my wisdom teeth out friday and im gonna be knocked out... im just afraid i wont wake up or something... can someone give me a play by play as to what they do?,The anesthetist (the doctor who will put you to sleep and monitor your vitals during the operation) will review your medical history and ensure you are in good health, and there are no medical problems which would make it dangerous to undergo general anesthetic.  They will start an IV in your hand or arm.  They will start running in a solution of normal saline.  You will feel a cool sensation in your arm as this starts to flow.  The anesthetist will continue to speak to you and tell you when he starts to administer the medication that will put you to sleep.  You will likely not even remember the exact moment that you went to sleep.  The next thing you will know, you will be in the recovery room speaking to the recovery nurse.  The entire procedure for wisdom tooth extraction should take no more than 20-25 minutes, so you won't be out for very long.
__label__8 , Who has seen An American Haunting and how was it?,,I was also at the screening at the Arclight theaters and I have to say how bad it really was. It was trying so hard to be the next great American horror film. The music was so redundant and overdone. And yes there were little girls with long black hair AGAIN in some scenes. The POV of the spirit is the lamest thing I've ever seen. It's also very redundant. The whole dream/nightmare/memory thing...whatever it was...felt so unnecessary and redundant. There's so much redundancy and boredom to this film. The only reason why I jumped at some parts and many times why I do this in horror movies is because of the loud music. Who doesn't jump at sudden bursts of trumpet sounds? And Rachel-Hurd Wood was not that great either. She was much more believable in Peter Pan. She needed a rougher edge to her character and I think her innocence in real life bleeds through too much in her character. There was also a very awkward scene where she does the whole twitching-I'm possessed-help me act and the family is just staring and edited in a way that makes them look so careless. I couldn't help but laugh. Her whole twitching thing looked so fake as well. For some reason that moment totally made me picture the director shouting out his commands scream! shake harder..HARDER!! And Donald Sutherland can not act in this as well. And Sissy Spacek I feel like just wants money. She hasn't been in anything good since In the Bedroom. Story's pretty weird. For devil's sake....it's the same director as Dungeons and Dragons. He was ranting on to a select few of us outside the theater of the plot points and why people did this and that. No one can possibly know that the first viewing. Ok..enough of my ranting. I think with a lot of smart editing, and different choices of music placing, this film can be somewhat good.

The matter in the universe has gravitated towards each other forming planets, stars, galaxies, ... leaving a lot of empty space.  All this empty space is a vacuum, since by definaition, a vacuum is devoid of matter, empty.\n\nYou can ignore the fact that a true, total vacuum does not exist, not even is space.

__label__4 , what is a prarie?,,Prairie refers to an area of land in North America of low topographic relief that principally supports grasses and herbs, with few trees, and is generally of a mesic (moderate or temperate) climate. Most of the Great Plains, including the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Iowa, and much of Missouri and Minnesota, is considered prairie. French explorers called these areas prairie, from the French word for meadow. Almost all of this area has been converted into farmland in the last two hundred years. Sometimes in the United States and Canada distinction is made between the shortgrass vegetation of the High Plains west of the 100th meridian and the tallgrass vegetation to the east from central Texas to Minnesota and southern Manitoba. When this distinction is made, it is common to limit the word prairie to the tallgrass area.\n\nIn Canada, the terms Prairie provinces and the Prairies refer to the western provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, where prairie grasslands and shrubs abound (see Canadian Prairies).\n\nFire is an important part of prairie ecology; natural and human induced fires were common in historic prairie areas. Grazing by animals such as the American Bison and Prairie dogs also helped maintain the original prairie ecology. Small areas of prairies also exist in eastern North America, and it is possible that these were created by Native Americans by periodic burning. One such area was along the southeastern shore of Lake Erie in what is now Pennsylvania and New York; another was between Seneca Lake and Cayuga Lake in present New York.\n\n \nPrairie grassesPrairies are considered part of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome by ecologists, based on similar temperate climates, moderate rainfall, and grasses, herbs, and shrubs, rather than trees, as the dominant vegetation type. Other temperate grasslands regions include the Pampas of Argentina, and the steppes of Russia and Ukraine.

__label__2 , why is salt water important for fish?,,A fish adapted to salt water must have a certain concentration of salt in the water because of osmotic pressure. \n\nThe cells of a fish don't have cell walls, just like all animal cells. \n\nIf a salt water fish is put into fresh water, too much water will rush into its cells.  As you can imagine, this is not too good for the cell. \n\nSome fish are adapted to live in fresh water part of their lives and salt water part of their lives. I really don't know how they do that, but then again, I'm not an ichthyologist.
__label__9 , if your mate is addicted to internet porn?,and it is affecting your intimate relationship, including deception and lack of physical contact, what would you do?,Define addicted.  Are they looking at it every day for hours on end, or is it more of a preference (i.e., they're choosing the porn over you)?  \n\nIf they're looking at it for hours every day, then he/she has a serious problem and should probably seek therapy.  If they refuse, say goodbye and don't look back.\n\nHowever, if it's the latter, then this is a problem you could potentially work out on your own.  Rather than condemning your significant other for looking at porn, why not try to get involved?  How about initiating a fun night of porn surfing together?  Odds are they'd much prefer have someone else pleasure them than pleasure themselves.

__label__4 , is a window a viscous fluid?,,The answer to that is no. The old glass is a slow moving liquid bit is an old wives tale. Or in this case, an old professors tale.\n\nThe essential reason is that in a fluid all the molecules are disordered and only loosely bound. While in glass the molecues are strongly bound, although disordered. \n\nThere is some wiggle room in the definition of solid and liquid, but it probably doesn't matter in this instance. The main evidence for glass being a liquid is the claim that glass in, say, old buildings has slowly settled and made the bottom thinker has never been shown to be due to glass being a liquid. In fact, the existence of perfectly fine glass from the time of the Roman Empire makes it unlikely.\n\nThe second link I've included is an extensive discussion of the whole windows are flowing down bit - the conclusion being, that it is more likely the panes were made with uneven thickness and the glass was inserted with the thicker end down - which  is the logical thing to do in that circumstance.

__label__7 , what are the problems encountered by the children in facing the reality of life ?,,Death. Of all, I find that death is one of the realities of life that children find the most weird. They cannot cope very easily with the loss of a friend, a family member or anybody close to them. Heck, even the death of a complete stranger baffles them. The dead goldfish, the tabby puss - anything that encounters with death, will completely scare the children.\n\nMost of the time, they fear that death will come to take away their remaining loved ones. The only way I see to solve this is to explain and reassure them that death is not something that should be feared, but something that should be respected; a whole new level where death is a better place for people to go to. It is a place of peace and love. In this way, children believe that death is no longer a place of sadness or sorrow and to that they hold forever...

__label__4 , directions for taking concrete slump tests at project site?,,Get a slump cone, scoop and tamping rod from a concrete accessories supplier. As the concrete is being discharged from the truck scoop some concrete into your cone which is clean and held down on a flat level surface. Fill it up to a third full then give it 25 tamps with the rod. Top it up to two thirds full then give it another 25 tamps, then fill it right up to the top and give it another 25 tamps. Level off the top then slowly lift the cone off, allowing the concrete to slump down beneath it. Set the cone upside down beside the concrete, place the rod on top of the cone and across the top of the concrete and measure down from the rod to the top of the concrete. This measurement is the slump value of the concrete. Make sure you wear gloves when handling concrete. Don't use a bucket to move the concrete from the truck to the cone and don't twist the cone as you lift it off the concrete as a lot of people do. There you go! Good luck

__label__4 , What is a good in class excericise in leadership?,,Do some fun group activities. My favorite: On a piece of paper (don't show it do anyone yet) the teacher draws random shapes, lines, squiggles. Each student grabs a partner, and one partner goes to look at your paper. The artist partners then copy down your drawing. Each artist must explain to their partner with words but no gestures how to draw the picture without showing it to them.\n\nThis strengthens the ability to give and follow directions.

__label__6 , when the last time of leather ball used in world cup?,,WC 1966 in England.\n\nMost modern balls are stitched from 32 panels of waterproofed leather or plastic: 12 regular pentagons and 20 regular hexagons. The 32-panel configuration is similar to the polyhedron known as the truncated icosahedron, except that it is more spherical, because the faces bulge due to the pressure of the air inside. The first 32-panel ball was marketed by Select in the 1950s in the United States. This configuration became common throughout Continental Europe in the 1960s, and was publicised worldwide by the Adidas Telstar, the official ball of the 1970 World Cup.\n\nOlder balls were usually stitched from 18 oblong non-waterproof leather panels, similar to the design of modern volleyballs and Gaelic footballs, and laced to allow access to the internal air bladder. This configuration is still common, as are more novel ones, such as the 26-panel Mitre PRO 100T, and the 14-panel Adidas Teamgeist. There are also indoor footballs, which are made of one or two pieces of plastic. Often these have designs printed on them to resemble a stitched leather ball.

You do not bend your hips when jumping off the ground, hence the hip flexors have little involvement in this action.\n\nThe hip extensors are gluteus maximus, medius and minimus.  You can make these muscles larger by doing squats and jumping exercises.

See:\nhttp://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=13292&topic=1555\n\nIf you have already tried the recommendations from that site, the alternate technique is just to use the SMTP setup defined by your ISP.  If you do not understand how to do this, either gmail help or your ISP help should be able to advise you.

Statutes or Case Law only please.,The law under which the Selective Service System operates is the Military Selective Service Act. (Act of June 24, 1948, c. 625, 62 Stat. 604, as amended; 50 U.S.C. App. 451 et seq.). Selective Service Regulations are contained in Part 1600 of Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations (32 CFR 1600).\n\nWho must register? according to http://www.sss.gov/must.htm\nAlmost all male U.S. citizens regardless of where they live, and male immigrant aliens residing in the U.S., are required to be registered with Selective Service if they are at least 18 years old but are not yet 26 years old. Men who are 26 years old and older are too old to register. \n\nWhat are the penalties if you do not register?  According to http://www.sss.gov/FSbenefits.htm \nRegistration is the law. A man who fails to register may, if prosecuted and convicted, face a fine of up to $250,000 and/or a prison term of up to five years. \n\nEven if not tried, a man who fails to register with Selective Service before turning age 26 may find that some doors are permanently closed.\n\n\nAh, okay I got your drift now.  A google search of step forward selective services comes up with a number of ways to avoid INDUCTION when registering.

__label__8 , What is the most embarrassing thing you have done lately?,,This wasn't my fault, but it was I who got embarrassed....\nLast night my boyfriend's daughter locked the keys in the car by accident and it was the only set of keys. So we had to wait there until someone brought a metal hanger, and I had to crawl on top of the car and fish with the hanger through the sunroof (that wasn't completely open; it was open like 2-3 inches). Everyone in the gas station was laughing their butts off because of me crawling all over the top of the car and then once I got the keys, I almost fell off the car. So at least I gave everyone a good laugh!♥

We have been good friends and found myself having feelings for him, especially when we said our goodbye's.  Since he has e-mailed me and he said that he has thought about me alot since he left and misses me.  Not sure what to do about it. I am very happy to hear this because i know I'm in love with him i just know he is going thru a seperation/divorce.  Stupid question but do you think he has strong feelings for me?   I don't know how to seperate friendship vs love in this situation ??,Whew, tangled web...first, he is going through a separation with his wife and if you care about him at all, you will be his friend and tell him you are there for him in that capacity but don't want to complicate his ability to sort through by you getting involved on top of it.  You are growing more fond as you daydream about him, because that is always the case, absence makes the heart grow fonder and that is true, we fantasize about the coulda, woulda, shoulda's in our lives. The best thing you can do is keep going in your world and though you keep a special place in your heart for him, wish him and his family the very best.  If when he works through everything and time goes by, it all works between the two of you, that will be glorious and at least you will know you weren't the reason for his marriage's failure.  Nothing like coming into a relationship on an equal footing for all the right reasons.  Good luck.

__label__5 , how can i write a c programme that calls a function Euclid's algorithm?,The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two positive integers is the largest integer which can be divided evenly into both integers.\nProblem 1: Given two integers A and B (assume that A > B) write a C program that calls a function called primitiveGCD( A,B) to calculate the GCD of two positive integers. This function uses a simple algorithm based on successive test of all numbers less than or equal to B, in order to find the greatest common divisor.\nThe pseudo-algorithm for implementing the function is as follows:\n1. Require that A ≥ 0 and B ≥ 0\n2. If A < B swap A and B\n3. Set g = B\n4. While g does not simultaneously divide A and B let g=g-1\n5. Return g\nProblem 2: Similar to the problem 1 chapter 5 page 338 of the textbook.\nEuclide’s algorithm for calculating the GCD of two positive integers is based on the following observation:\nGiven two nonnegative integers A and B where (A > B), then the greatest common divisor of A and B is also the common divisor of A%B and B.,int primitiveGCD(int A, int B){\n  int g;\n  if (A < 0 || B < 0 ) return -1; /*error*/\n  g = B;\n  if (A < B){B = A; A = g; g = B;}\n  /* if g is not a factor of either it will return true value and it will continue looping */\n  while(A%g || B%g)g--;\n\n  return g;\n}\n\nYou can at least write the program. Cheating doesn't help you learn.

Terrorists are extremely real and there existance is extremely dangerous.\nAnd the Democrats answer to this is to bestow constitutional rights upon terrorists?\nTo take Guantanamo terrorists and put them into American prison general populatrion so they can recruit men that are already criminals with an innate sense of hate for society to begin with?\nTo eliminate data gathering on American based terrorists?\nTo vote against shoring up the Texas/Mexico border?\nTo pull out of Iraq which is also a pivot point to other terrorist nations i.e. Iran, Syria, and Afghanistan.\nWhen it comes to Homeland Security, folks, I think you democratic voters have thrown America back to the wolves.\nI voted Republican. If you voted democrat I'm afraid you will soon be in need of the right words for your sincere apologies to our nation and our beloved United States of America.

__label__7 , How much should you pay a real estate agent?,This is in California, where houses cost (believe it or not) like $800K+. A standard 6% commission would be $50,000,which seems totally excessive. So what should I offer when negotiating a rate with an agent?,Everything is negotiable.\n\nBear in mind, a GOOD agent will make the money (and more) back for you.  1% difference in commission is about $8000.  If you have a good negotiator working for you, you'll probably easily make more than the $8000 difference.  \n\nI offer commission breaks when I know I'm doing more than one 'side'.  That is, if you will let me help you find your next place, I'll cut my selling commission to you by 1%.  It's just good business.\n\nBut interestingly enough, I don't have to discount my commission very often.  The reason is because I have a full blown marketing campaign that covers ALL the bases.  If you're going to pay for a full commisssion, it should be because you're getting full service.  If you're in a very hot market, then find a discounter who will put it in the MLS.  DFW Texas isn't white hot like some parts of the country, and it actually takes a little work to get it sold.\n\nSo really it comes down to your market.  \n\nOne other negotiating tip:  Don't offer an agent.  Have them offer you.  Some of them will likely roll over on you and give you a heavily discounted rate.  Beware the ones who discount too much, too fast.  If they can't negotiate worth a darn with you, how are they going to do when a buyer's agent like me comes along!  :)\n\nGood luck.

__label__2 , Why does your pee smell funky when you eat asparragus?,Your pee smells like asparragus,It's the smell of asparagine - one of the 20 common amino acids - and its derivatives. You get this from many sources as well as asparagus, but it is named after it (as it was first isolated from asparagus) and occurs in high levels in this vegetable.
__label__4 , which college at home is the best for A.S. dergee (teacher aid)?,,Well, first we need to know where home is...lol!\n\nYour local junior college should have a teacher aide program. If you want to work online, contact your state's Department of Education for a list of acceptable online programs (don't want to do all the work, and find the state/district won't take your diploma).\n\nIn my state (New Mexico), a highly qualified educational assistant has 60 college credits/Associate's Degree, and has passed a paraprofessional standardized test. \n\nUnlike other jobs in education, the EA position is indeed paid similar to other career positions with similar levels of education, at the entry level. However, the pay doesn't increase much, so that by the time you're in your 10th or 15th year, a veteran office or medical/dental assistant is making almost twice as much as you.\n\nBut then, does any of us go into education for the money? lol.

But after putting on XP home. My usb port (only one) doesn't work . I tried contacting Microsoft site.. They told me to try this and try that .Still nothing. I haven't got the the windows 98 cd...never had one..Or i would put it back.. Also haven'y got the XP one eirther... It there someplace I can get a free copy of either Or how do I fix my poblem??,First you should check in your BIOS.  IT is possible that since the machine had WIN98 originally that the BIOS never had USB support turned on.  IF that is not the case then check with HP's site to see if there is an update to your existing BIOS.  This might have the patch needed to activate you USB.\n\nIt sounds more like it is turned off in the BIOS though.

__label__4 , I am doing a project and need help!?,I need people to help me because our theme is perspectives and I need peoples perspectives so here goes I am doing three different places and asking questions is the autientic food better then the fast food? and I am doing:\nFazolis vs. athintec italian food\nwhich is better and why and also what is different?\nChina buffet vs.athintec chinese food\nwhich is better and why and also what is different?\n& Taco bell vs. athintec mexican food\nwhich is better and why and also what is different?\nPLEASE HELP ME PEOPLE if I fail this project I will fail 8th grade and also get kicked out of my school! So if people have answers for me please give them. Also if people are from like italy mexico and chiana that would be great for you to tell me what your food taste like and your opinion on the food and stuff. So thanks for reading please help bye!,In general, authentic food is made fresh from fresh ingredients. Fast food is pre-made, (mass produced) frozen and shipped to stores where it is microwaved. That leads to another big difference, which is fast food has preservatives (sometimes lots of them), which freshly prepared food does not. Next, authentic food is prepared using the spices and even cooking techniques that are uniqe to the culture and tastes. fast food is not, and often relies on salt and fats for achieving better taste. Unrelated to the actual taste of the food, dining in a restaurant versus out of a bag is a much better dining experience. These are all big differences in my opinion that make authntic food the better choice.
__label__10 , Why do conservatives so often think that somebody is too blame for somebody being a liberal?,It seems that it is always somebody/something's fault for somebody being a liberal.\n\nLiberal media\nLiberal education\nLiberal parents\n\nWhy can't it just be that it is something they formed on their own?  Of course we are all a product of our environment, but I have friends who have had very similar upbringings (same school, same neighborhood...etc) as my own and we have very different political views.  I know a couple people who are very liberal and their fathers are ministers in very traditional churches.,conservatives fear free thinkers ones they can't control. so they blame everything bad on liberals because they have no solutions of their own. it's the old blame game.

__label__2 , How to graph the function of Y^2=X(Ysquare) on a TI-86 calculator?,How can we graph a function with respect to Y on a graphing calculator: ie. X=Y^2+2Y,X = Y^2 is not a function. It fails the vertical line test. You cannot graph it on a graphing calculator. (At least not a TI-86.)\n\nYou need to break it into two pieces that don't have multiple y values per x value. In this case, x = y^2 breaks nicely into \ny = square root of x\nand y = - square root of x\n\nAs far as I know, you can't graph X as a function to Y on any TI graphing calculators, but I only know up to the TI-89. You can simulate a graph of a f(y) = x equation but you have to convert it into a piecewise function.

Our bodies don't have peroxidase because it breaks down hydrogen peroxide.Peroxide is produced as a harmful byproduct of respiration. The body needs to break down peroxide because it is a powerful oxidizer and acts as a free radical. If peroxide builds up in the body, cellular damage may happen.

Do they just appear or did they craw there? How?... \n\nI've seen bottles with maggots inside (because whatever it contained had gone bad)... so... how did it happen?!,You shouldn't be getting any worms....\nMaggots are fly larvae - meaning that flies have laid eggs in your food (you've seen flies attracted to rotting food, I'm sure). the eggs hatch and the larvae slowly grow until they form a pupa and transform into an adult fly.

The muscles of her body tense up and when the orgasm come they are suddenly released.   You should also be able to feel the contractions of her vagina if her vaginal muscles are strong enough.   Of course she can fake that by squeezing them, but she has to really be trying to fake if she can remember to squeeze her vaginal muscles too.

__label__10 , What became of the liberals who claimed the Communist USSR would never crumble?,,Reality. What you find with extreme partisans and I include extremist right wingers as well as the left wing is that when their claims are proved false they just change rhetoric. As to the what they have said before, they will either never mention it again, or deny that they ever said it in the first place if challenged. When denials do not work they resort to the final tactic in their arsenal which is too discredit anyone who doesn't agree as stupid or intolerant depending on the issue.\n\nWow, what short memories some people have. Did those posting that it was never stated live through the eighties? There was constant rhetoric in the media and political circles to this effect. I don't remember how many times a week we heard that Mr. Reagan was just a dangerous cowboy who was going to lead us into a nuclear war with the Soviet Union and that our goals would never be achieved.

The virus causes inflamation of the eyes (conjuctivitis), nose (rhinitis), throat(laryngitis), and if it spreads to the ear(otitis).\nInfalmation causes the release of histamines which cause itching to release sites eg itchy ears, throat, etc.

Is it essential for Life?,,Numerology is the study of the purported mystical or esoteric relationship between numbers and the character or action of physical objects and living things.\n\nNumerology and numerological divination were popular among early mathematicians such as Pythagoras, but are no longer considered to be part of mathematics and are now regarded as pseudomathematics by most mathematicians. This is similar to the historical development of astronomy from astrology, and that of chemistry from alchemy.

Look for any program that is like iTunes. Chances are, it'll let you download from your iPod.\n\nAnother way is to open your iPod drive, and on the Toolbar above, click |Tools|, |Folder Options|. Click the |View| tab, and look for |Hidden Files or Folders|. Click the radio button next to |Show Hidden Files or Folders|. A new folder will be visible, but it will be slightly transparent. It is called iPod Control. Search in there for your music. It will have been renamed and everything, but it still will be the same as your origianl song. You'll have to do a bit of searching, unfortunately, but this is the best thing to do in the case of being at a friends house, where you're not allowed to download software.

__label__2 , Can Lectricity  be collected  from lightning and stored?,I could use some of that lectricity it cost so much these days.,Where to begin?\n\nI guess first I'll say there is no such thing as electricity, as far as some tangible resource you can store and generate.  There is charge, voltage, and current, and the only one you can truly store is charge (but with charge, you can create a voltage difference, which can, in turn, create current).  \n\nSecond, the link given above is to someone posting an idea they had about storing lightning with capacitors.  It has not been done and, to the best of my knowledge, is unfeasible.  Storing the energy (not the charge) from the lightning strike is much more feasible, but still not likely to happen for a long time.  \n\nIn short, if YOU were thinking of collecting lightning, storing the charge, and then using it to power your home, you can't do it, and you'd be well advised not to try.  If some brave researcher were to have been able to store a few kilojoules from a lightning strike at some point, I wouldn't be too surprised, but at this point, it's just not happening.
__label__7 , sheriff sale/ foreclosures question for allegheny county?,I found a property I would like to bid on at sheriff sale. I have a couple questions before moving forward though. Any advice would be appreciated big time.\n\n1. Senior loan judgement leading to sheriff sale. This wipes out all \nother creditors except taxes?\n\n2. I have about $5,000 for 10% down payment. How can I go about getting a loan for the rest? This would be my first home purchase.\n\nThanks again for the help.,As to your first question, generally yes, the sale of this property will wipe out all other creditors. The exception would be if something wasn't found on the report that they use (typically the attorney who is handling the foreclosure orders a report that guarantees the sale). The attorneys use this report to make sure that everyone has been notified. That's also why they are required to post the sale in conspicuous places. So, I would recommend getting a title search to see what is in fact out there on this property.\n\nAs to the second question, that's the hard part about buying from a foreclosure or seizure. The lender takes time to do all of it's stuff (underwriting, appraisals, etc), and normally you don't have a lot of time before the sale. I'd suggest talking to your bank or your local mortgage consultants. Tell them exactly what you want to do, and they'll tell you whether or not they can help. Hopefully, you'll find one that can, but it won't be easy. Typically at a foreclosure/seizure/sheriff's sale, you need to have the money within moments of having the winning bid. Okay, that part isn't so bad, but what if there are other people bidding against you? It doesn't happen often (in my 5 years of this, I never saw it happen and only heard of it once), but it can happen. \n\nI hope all of this helps out. Good luck, I hope you get it and that it's in immaculate shape!

Thanks.,Eating or drinking sugar does not cause diabetes..Family history,being over weight, lack of exercise..is the main reasons people get it.\nWhen you have diabetes your body doesn't produce and or use insulin properly,,That is why a person with diabetes has to watch what food/drinks they consume..because their body doesn't use insulin the way ..say yours does.. \n If you don't have major risk factors for it 4 teaspoons of sugar a day will not cause you to have diabetes..If you want a good alternative to real sugar try splenda..it tastes just like real sugar...I use it in my kids kool-aid and they love it. Also my mom used to be a sugar hound and I gave her a bag of splenda last year and she hasn't bought real sugar again..she even bakes with it..

__label__3 , how fast can you get lung cancer?,Is it possible to get lung cancer (or any smoking related cancer) from a single cigarette (even if it's hard to prove)\nor is lung cancer just possible at a long time use of cigarettes?,LUNG CANCER\nLung cancer is a malignant tumour of the lungs. Most commonly it is bronchogenic carcinoma (about 90%). Lung cancer is the most lethal malignant tumour worldwide, causing up to 3 million deaths annually. Only one in ten patients diagnosed with this disease will survive the next five years. Although lung cancer was previously an illness that affected predominately men, the lung cancer rate for women has been increasing in the last few decades, which has been attributed to the rising ratio of female to male smokers.\n\n \nThe incidence of lung cancer is highly correlated with smoking. The above is an illustration for the United States incidence of lung cancer.Current research indicates that the factor with the greatest impact on risk of lung cancer is long-term exposure to inhaled carcinogens. The most common means of such exposure is tobacco smoke.\n\nTreatment and prognosis depend upon the histological type of cancer and the stage (degree of spread). Possible treatment modalities include surgery, chemotherapy\n\n\nSigns and symptoms\nSymptoms that suggest lung cancer include:\n\ndyspnea (shortness of breath) \nhemoptysis (coughing up blood) \nchronic cough \nwheezing \nchest pain \ncachexia (weight loss), fatigue and loss of appetite \ndysphonia (hoarse voice) \nclubbing of the fingernails (uncommon) \nIf the cancer grows into the lumen it may obstruct the airway, causing breathing difficulties. This can lead to accumulation of secretions behind the blockage, predisposing the patient to pneumonia.\n\nMany lung cancers have a rich blood supply. The surface of the cancer may be fragile, leading to bleeding from the cancer into the airway. This blood may subsequently be coughed up.\n\nDepending on the type of tumor, so-called paraneoplastic phenomena may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, this may be Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to auto-antibodies), hypercalcemia and SIADH. Tumors in the top (apex) of the lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to changed sweating patterns and eye muscle problems (a combination known as Horner's syndrome), as well as muscle weakness in the hands due to invasion of the brachial plexus.\n\nIn many patients, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site by the time they have symptoms and seek medical attention. Common sites of metastasis include the bone, such as the spine (causing back pain and occasionally spinal cord compression) and the brain.\n\nTypes\nThere are two main types of lung cancer categorised by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a microscope: small-cell (roughly 20%) and non-small cell (80%) lung cancer. This classification although based on simple pathomorphological criteria has very important implications for clinical management and prognosis of the disease.\n\n\nCauses\nExposure to carcinogens, such as those present in tobacco smoke, immediately causes cumulative changes to the tissue lining the bronchi of the lungs (the bronchial mucous membrane) and more tissue gets damaged until a tumour develops.\n\nThere are four major causes of lung cancer (and, actually, cancer in general):\n\nCarcinogens such as those in cigarette smoke \nRadiation exposure \nGenetic susceptibility \nViral infection \n\n\nThe role of smoking\nSmoking, particularly of cigarettes, is believed to be by far the main cause of lung cancer, which at least in theory makes it one of the easiest diseases to prevent. In the United States, smoking is estimated to account for 87% of lung cancer cases in the U.S. (90% in men and 79% in women). There are hundreds of known carcinogens—such as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons—present in cigarette smoke. The length of time a person continues to smoke as well as the amount smoked increases the person's chances of contracting lung cancer. If a person stops smoking, these chances steadil

__label__2 , Is 5/16 less than or greater than 0.313?,,5/16 equals 0.3125.  It's less than 0.313 unless .313 is a rounded off number.  It's considered acceptable to round off a decimal in this fashion.\n\nWhen to Round Up\nRounding up means that we increase the terminating digit by a value of 1 and drop off the digits to the right. If the next place beyond where we are terminating the decimal is greater than or equal to five, we round up. For example, if we round 5.47 to the tenths place, it can be can be rounded up to 5.5.\n\nWhen to Round Down\nIf the number to the right of our terminating decimal place is four or less (4, 3, 2, 1, 0), we round down. This is done by leaving our last decimal place as it is given and discarding all digits to its right. For example, if we round 6.734 to the hundredths place, it can be rounded down to 6.73.

__label__2 , why the transition metals have high melting point, have high density, and forming coloured?,why they're called as a collection of metal?,Transition metals have high melting points because they are metals! All metals have high melting points! But some transition metals have exceptionally high melting points like Vanadium and Nickiel because they form a partially half filled 3-d subshell (for Vanadium) and a fully filled 3-d orbital (for Nickiel), which adds to an extra stability to the element. Hence, it is more difficult to remove the electron and thus result in the high melting point. \n\n\nSince transition metals are all in the 4th period, its Ar would be large too. Since Ar is large, naturally density would be high. \n\nBecause mass=no. of molecules x Ar \n\nAnd density is defined as mass / volume. \n\n\nThe specialty of transition mentals is that the energy levels of the orbitals are close enough to overlap each other. When electrons of a transition metal gains energy and is excited, it is promoted to the 4s orbital. \n\n\nHowever, it is unstable at that level and soon drops back to the 3d-orbital. In order to return to the 3d-orbital, it must remove some of its energy, and the energy is light. That is why there are different colours in transition metals. Because it only releases a specific amount of energy, which relects different colours of light. This process is also known as d-d transition.

__label__2 , Need help in building a small dam (about half a foot in height) to prevent erosion of soil?,In the place where I live, during rains the ground besides me becomes a small stream. What that does is that it erodes the soil and the place becomes very uneven after monsoon. So every year we have to bring truckload of soil to fill the small gorges. So this time I built a small mud dam but then during heavy rainfall the water flows over it and takes the soil with it. So what should I do so that the soil does not get eroded or water doesn't flow? And for ur information the place has a slope of about 10-15 degrees,several courses of action should be taken.\n\nif there is no alternative to the slope, then you should force the water to go a longer distance, and make the slope smaller, like a down hill skier.  reducing the slope and putting in many bends will slow the water down more.  \n\nupstream, a retention pond should be put in, or a sizable pool that will fill with water, slow down the water, and really delay the water form heading downstream all at once.  although if you have monsoons, this may not have maximum effect.\n\nduring the dry season, plant in the streambed and beside it where the water goes.  try to use plants that are typically in or near the water or the stream.  this will slow the water down, and the roots will help hold onto soil to keep it from washing away.\n\nafter these options, a small dam could be put in.  start by placing wooden or metal poles in a line, slightly bowed out going upstream, across the stream bed.  from there, place wooden or metal poles laid down across the perpendicular poles.  then place the soil on top of that.  in the middle of the dam, you will want it open in a v shape going up the dam, to allow water to still pass through.  a v shape will allow the little bit of water to pass when it is dryer, but more to pass when it is wetter.  ideally you should put a layer of concrete over the dam to stop it from eroding, but if not, then just pack it very tightly and put more plants right into the dam.\n\nthough some of this sounds expensive and time consuming, will save in the end if you dont have to truck in the sand.\n\n\n\nif its part of a road, use cement/ brick/ mudbricks over the section that water flows on.  if its a short section, see if it would be possible to install a culvert (pipe) so that water will flow under and not over the road.\n\nwithout additional information, i can only suggest rocks and boulders in the area to slow the water and prevent erosion.  other techniques that you can research that are more specific to your situation may be found on a yahoo search, or if you have some money, invite an engineer (geotechnical or civil) to the site if possible.

We are supposed to have a long talk on saturday and she said it could go either way, which i really don't know what to say now. I asked her if she still loves me and i get i don't know. but if i say i love you she says love you too, iam soo confused what to say or do.i just sent flowers and a sorry card to her work maybe she will see that iam really sorry. can you help me even though i messed up bad.jeff,You messed up but its not worth ending a 3 year relationship over.

__label__1 , What ever happened to the lost tribes of Israel?,Do you think they will ever return?\nWill they have to become Jews if they do?,Hi there,\n\nI'm a historian and I focus on ancient history. I can tell you that the 10 lost tribes were taken out of the Northern Israelite Kingdom, known as Samria in the early 8th century BC. This is when the Assyrian Armies captured Samaria, not only is this documented in history but in the bible as well. I think it's in I Kings. \n\nAnyway, after the Assyrian conquest, the 10 tribes were scattered throughout the eastern portion of the Assyrian Empire by King Sargon. From this point on it appears that they took the name Scythians (or Kuthia in Persian). However, there's no real proof of the name-change. It is well known however, that historically speaking they ceased to be a people after the Assyrian conquest, and other peoples were relocated to Samaria from throughout the Empire to populate Samaria. These new people, not at all related to the Jews that still lived in Judea. \nI hope this helps you. God bless!

Do they jog for 10 mins, walk a few, then jog more, etc.? \n\nOr is it more healthy to jog straight for 20 minutes? Or more!?\n\nWhat is best for your body?\n\nAnd... how much more energy does it take to jog outside, rather then on a treadmill?\n\nThanks.,You should jog at a comfortable pace (you should be able to say a sentence semi-comfortably) for more than twenty minutes. Slow down if you need to. Stop if you have any chest pain. \n\nThe first 5 minutes or so are more of a warm-up: go a little slower at first, then increase your speed. Also, cool-down after your 20 minutes are up (start with a power walk and wind down to a good mall pace). Don't forget to stretch before and after a workout- it will make your workout more productive. \n\nAs for the workout itself, for the first 20 minutes, you're getting cardio benefits (aerobic exercise). After 20 minutes, you're in anaerobic exercise...you're no longer burning fat, but building muscle. Muscle will increase your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which will increase the caloric need of your body...so it helps you to lose even more weight!\n\nAs for treadmills v. outside: it's a matter of person preference: \nTreadmills:\n   Advantages: help you keep up your pace, can vary terrain/incline to your preference, can see the calories you're burning \n   Disadvantage: sometimes it can be more difficult to breathe indoors\nOutside: \n   Advantages: ever-changing scenery, cleaner air \n   Disadvantage:less control over terrain/incline\n\n\nEnergy requirements depend on the speed, duration, and incline of your workout, as well as your current health status.

__label__2 , Is global warming a result of Industrialization?  What are other possiblilities?,,Industrialization sure contributes to the phenomenon known as global warming. But, if I am to understand correctly, then, according to a scientist featured in a program I once came across on the Discovery Channel (Canada), a couple of hundred million years ago, a most unique event occurred, one most rare and that never before occurred in earth's history.\n\nThere are 4 things that can and do dramatically affect the earth's temperature, besides the heat generated by its core. These are volcanic eruptions, especially gigantice ones such as the 1883 eruption of Mount Krakatoa in Indonesia, comet, asteroid and meteroic impacts, what phase the earth is in during its orbit around the sun and, finally, how far towards or away from the sun the axis it revolves around is tilting.\n\nAny one of these can reduce the earth's overall temperature and make for a harsher and/or longer winter. Two of these create truly severe conditions. But a couple of hundred million years ago, the incredible happened. The earth was in the long and most distant portion of its orbit around the sun, the portion we associate with winter, its axis was at its furthest possible tilt from the sun and it suffered a collision with a space object (though it's not clear yet whether this was a comet or an asteroid).\n\nThe fact that it was during its long, winter phase meant that the earth would be cold to begin with and would receive less light and heat from the sun than usual. The fact that its axis was at its furthest point from the sun meant that the winter season would be that much harsher and would last that much longer than usual. But the combined effect of all 3 factors created a vicious cycle.\n\nThe winter season meant that temperatures were cold to begin with and that there was snow and ice on the ground already. The distantly pointing axis and the particulates from the collision kept temperatures cold and reduced them further. This meant that come spring and summer, much less snow and ice melted than usual and at a much slower rate. This in turn meant that by the time the next winter season came, the precipitation (snow and ice) of the last one was still for the most part on the ground. This created a larger mass of ice and snow, which froze into ice. This larger mass further sucked even more heat from the air around it and the ground below it. That further reduced temperatures, which caused even more precipitation to fall and accumulate, resulting in an even larger mass of ice and snow. This created permanent glaciars and permitted the creation and growth of pernanent icecaps at the 2 poles. These events have since locked the earth in an ice age. An ice age has two periods, a warming period and a cooling period. \n\nSo what does this have to do with global warming you ask? Until such time as at least some scientists became convinced of the phenomenon you know as global warming, the earth was in a warming period. It is my opinion and belief, given the available data, that, just as the earth experienced the simultaneous occurrance of 3 factors that allowed the creation of permanent glaciars and polar ice-caps, it can also experience the simultaneous occurrance of factors at the other end of the spectrum and that that is what the earth is experiencing right now. So I believe that the phenomenon of global warming is natural, and thus I support it, but that is aggravated by industrialization (mostly the various forms of pollution and environmental degredation), which I do not support.\n\nWhatever your goals and intentions, the best thing you can do is to gather the maximum amount of available information, and understand what theories are being expounded and how many acknowledged figures support them, so as to be able to accurately and fairly perceive the situation as it truly is and form an informed and educated opinion about it. Finally, not to be selective or act as a form of propaganda, I highly recommend State of Fear by Mr. Micha

Production and distribution is primarily controlled by companies each acting in its own interest.\n\nThe Roman Empire would have met 1, 2 (mostly), 4 (usually), and 5 (although 5 generally would be individuals instead of companies).\n\n3 would be iffy, since slavery existed, and a lack of mobility prevented a truly free labor market outside of the largest cities.

We lie to you because we don't want you to know what we've been up to, of course, but a lot of the time we lie to you because that's what you want. You've decided what you want to hear and we just feed it out to you. We also lie to you with empty flattery because that's the best way of getting your knickers off. We lie to you a lot because it's the line of least resistance - it's easier to come up with some stupid line of bollocks than it is to get into an argument with you about trivia. We lie to you and we are going to keep on lying to you until the end of time. Take it or leave it.

__label__4 , tell me about a greek oracle?,Someone plzz tell me about a Greek oracle.\nGimme some info. THX,The word oracle in Greek can mean several related things. It means a god who predicts the future, like Apollo. It also means the priest who hears the message, and the message itself, and the place where the priest hears the message. Most often it means the priest or the message. \nThe Greeks believed (like all other ancient people) that you could communicate with the gods at certain places, at certain times, through certain people, and that the gods would give you advice and maybe tell you what was going to happen in the future. \n\nBut the Greek oracles had a couple of advantages too. First, you didn't just come and ask your question. You had to hang around the temple for a while, talking to the priests, so they could get to know you. And they could see you, not just hear your voice on the telephone. Second, everybody came to the same few oracles for help, and the priests at these oracles (unlike the Psychic Hotline) compared notes with each other. So if you asked Should I get married? and the oracle said Yes, and then next week your girlfriend comes and she asks, Will Gorgias ask me to marry him? then the oracle already knows the answer to that one. There is every reason to think that the oracles were worth the money they charged. \n\nhttp://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/LAO.html\nhttp://www.paralumun.com/greekfuture.htm

But with the repuglican propaganda machine cranked up with the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox news I guess you have to expect it.

__label__5 , Why should I use Windows instead instead of Mac OS?,What are the benefits and advantages of using Windows?,I use to be a Macintosh computer technician.  I really liked macs, they are easy to use.  They also are great computers to use for graphics.  BUT, I own a windows computer.  The cost of a mac is to much.  Windows computers are cheaper.  More software is available for the windows platform.  \nCost is the major reason that I picked windows.  As a technician, when people asked me which computer to buy, I told them to find the software that you like and buy the computer that will run that software.  Some software is only available on one operating system.  If both computers run the software that you like, then look in your pocketbook.  In my opinion, windows or mac os, one operating system is not better than the other.  They both have there strong and weak points.  Windows has more viruses than macs, but that is what virus programs (notice the s in programs) are for.  If you are practice safe internet searching, don't open unfamiliar emails, be careful were you go on the web, you should have a good experience.\nEmulators are great on the mac, but they do not run ALL windows software.\n\nI would prefer a mac, but I am not rich.  If I had a choice between mac os or windows os, say they were the same price, I would chose a mac.  The reality is, windows works great!

__label__10 , Should I sue the driver who hit me?,I was hit head on by a teenager who came into my lane.  She has a 20,000 dollar limit in what her insurance will pay for my medical bills.  My medical bills to date have been about 18,000-20,000 dollars and I am still in pain every day almost 1 and a half years later.  I am thinking about another surgery but I don't know if I will do it yet.  The alternative seems to be to live with the pain and numbness for the rest of my life.  I have to settle or file a lawsuit within the next 8 months.  My questions are:  1.  Is it ethical to sue her?  I am a Christian and believe in forgiveness.  I have forgiven her and I don't want to take that forgiveness back.  I am able to pay my medical bills beyond what the insurance will pay, but it's my husband's money, too, and I'm not sure what the future will bring.  \n2.  What is future pain and suffering worth, if anything?  I will never be the same.  I will always have some pain and some numbness, whether I choose to have another surgery or not.,Well, being a Christian does mean forgiveness; however, you shouldn't suffer do to the poor decisions of others.  If you do plan to sue, sue only for the exact amount in medical bills and lost income.  You are entitled to that amount.  Make sure you have receipts for everything.  It is not unethical to sue if your only in it for exact compensation and not for greed.

Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on how to get grants or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\nThe U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices. Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.
__label__4 , My question is in the bottom▼?,Hitler censored Eric Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the western front. Which details in the novel would cause Hitler to take such action? Considering Hitler's goals, was he justified in censoring the novel?,All Quiet on the Western Front was actually and anti-war story.   All Quiet on the Western Front was written in a first person style.  The story was told by Paul Baümer, a nineteen year old student, convinced to enlist with the German army by his schoolmaster, Kantorek.  Along with many of his friends from school, he is trained under Corporal Himmelstoss, a strictly disciplined commander who dislikes Paul because of his defiance.\n    When sent to the front, Paul, along with his other friends, made new friendships that would last throughout time.  His newly made friend/commander, was a man named Stanislaus Katczinsky.  As a man of forty years of age he was an wise old man as well as a friend to the young eighteen and nineteen year old recruits.  \n    After visiting the front for long stretches Paul is given fourteen days of leave where he can visit his ill mother at his own home.  After this leave he is sent back to training and then back to the front.  His trip is lengthened when he discovers that his unit has been reassigned to another area.  Finding his unit, he reunites with his friends and joins up with them again in the war efforts.\n      While searching in no man's land, Paul is confined to a shell hole for a long night.  During this night a French soldier falls in the hole and Paul stabs him.  The hours to come are very hard for Paul as he comforts and waits for the Frenchman to die.\n    Paul's group has a stroke of luck when they were assigned to defend a village.  Since no inhabitants were left they were able to go through the houses to take and use whatever they wanted.  This luck, however, did not last forever.   One day the French came and began shelling the village.  While evacuating Paul and his friend Albert Kropp were injured by gunshot wounds.  They were bandaged up and sent on a train back home.  \n    This ride home took a turn.  When Kropp got a fever he was scheduled to be dropped off at the next stop.  In order for Paul to stay with his friend, he had to convince the nurse that he also was sick from infection.  After being dropped off they were taken to a Catholic hospital to be treated.  After a few weeks Kropp's leg is overcome with infection and is amputated at the thigh.  After a few more weeks Paul and Kropp parted, Paul going back to the war and Kropp going home.\n    Returning to the front was hard for Paul.  The days were getting cold and one by one he watched his friends die.  The hardest loss was that of Kat.   After Kat had been shot, Paul had to carry Kat to the nearest dressing station a few miles away.  Stopping every few minutes to rest, Paul frequently checked to make sure that Kat, even with his injury, was ok.  When at last Paul reached the dressing station the nurse told him that Kat was dead.  When Paul checked again a small shell fragment had just penetrated that back of Kat's head.  He was still even warm.   Kat was the last of Paul's friends to die in the war.  Then, in October of 1918, Paul finally fell.  The book describes his death as, ...his face had an expression of calm, as though almost glad the end had come.  The war ended the next month. \n\nHitler diodn't appreciate the anti-war stance of the book. In the story war is described in horrific detail and it's futility questioned. All the characters die in awful circumstances, the hero Paul literally at the last moment of the war at 11 o'clock on 11th November 1918 just as peace was announced. It is set in World War I where Hitler himself serves as a messenger, although German propoganda later elevated him to the rank of Corporal (as there were no records below sergeant to verify this) and the he had won the Iron Cross, 1st Class, a medal for gallantry. As he never saw action this was pure fabrication. There is also section in the book where the hero Paul shares a hole with a french soldier and makes friends with him. Such fraternisation was no
__label__10 , The precendent for using federal troops to break up a major strike was set by?,,Sorry, you are both wrong, it was during the Pullman Strike in the 1800's.

This made the labor action a federal crime.
__label__9 , i need help getting my boyfriend back?,My boyfriend of 2 years left me yesterday. I asked his friends why he decided to leave me now, and their response is that when he found out i have leukemia, he freaked out because his little sister died of leukemia, and he thinks im going to die too. Last night my dad and mom who are both doctors sat down with him and told him that they got me the best doctor money can afford, so theres nothing to be scared about. But he still kept his orignal decision. how can i get him back?,I am so sorry sweetie about your condition but with science being what it is I am sure you will be okay.  As far as your boyfriend my original reaction was what a bastard! But he is still mourning his sister and maybe he can't go through with losing someone else who is close to him.\n\nYou can't make him come back to you, sorry to say you have to respect his decision and concentrate on getting better.  If he truly loved you he would be there for you and what a horrible way to find out the truth but at least you know now what he's made of.  He is still in shock so let him be, you deserve to have someone who loves you unconditionally and will always be there for you.\n\nThank God you have a wonderful support team in your parents.  Surround yourself with positive people and keep a positive attitude.  You have a major battle to contend with right now so focus on you.  Build your fortress and protect yourself.\n\nI wish you all the best and know you will be okay in every aspect of your life.  Let God and let go.

__label__4 , At Yale, why did the CIA want to take the Nathan Hale statue?,Yale refused to give it to them,I cannot say for sure, but it appears that the statue at Yale University is the original sculpture.  The other locations, including CIA have replicas.  My guess is that the CIA wanted the original - but Yale has no motivation to part with that bit of history.\n\nFrom first link:\nA statue of Hale, sculpted around 1898 by Bela Lyon Pratt, was cast in 1912 and stands in front of Connecticut Hall at Hale's alma mater, Yale. Copies of this sculpture stand at the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts; the Nathan Hale Homestead; the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.; and at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nFrom CIA tour (second link):\n\nOne of three sculptures on the grounds, this statue is a replica of the original work created in 1914 for Yale University, Nathan Hale's alma mater, by Bela Lyon Pratt. The Agency's copy of the statue was erected on the grounds in 1973, 200 years after his graduation from Yale.
__label__6 , Free Agents in the NBA?,What's the difference between a restricted and non-restriced free agent.  Is it in the clause of your contract that allows you to be either one?,Whether you are a restricted or unrestricted free agent in the NBA depends on the amount of time you have in the league when your current contract expires. If you have a certain amount of service time then you can become an unrestricted free agent, meaning that you can sign with any team for any amount of money. If you have less than the prescribed time in the league than you can shop around with other teams and get an offer for yourself. However, if your current team matches that offer in the time alotted, then you have to go and play for them. That is the difference. I am not sure what amount of service in the league you have to have to qualify for unrestricted free agency.

__label__2 , how many types of lipo-proteins are there?,,A lipoprotein is a biochemical assembly that contains both proteins and lipids. The lipids or their derivatives may be covalently or non-covalently bound to the proteins. Many enzymes, transporters, structural proteins, antigens, adhesins and toxins are lipoproteins. Examples include the high density and low density lipoproteins of the blood, the transmembrane proteins of the mitochondrion and the chloroplast, and bacterial lipoproteins.\n\nGeneral categories of lipoproteins, listed in order from larger and less dense (more fat than protein) to smaller and more dense (more protein, less fat):\n\nChylomicrons - carry triacylglycerol (fat) from the intestines to the liver and to adipose tissue. \n\nVery low density lipoproteins - carry (newly synthesised) triacylglycerol from the liver to adipose tissue.\n \nIntermediate density lipoproteins - are intermediate between VLDL and LDL. They are not usually detectable in the blood. \nLow density lipoproteins - carry cholesterol from the liver to cells of the body. Sometimes referred to as the bad cholesterol lipoprotein. \n\nHigh density lipoproteins - collects cholesterol from the body's tissues, and brings it back to the liver. Sometimes referred to as the good cholesterol lipoprotein. \n\nAlpha and beta\nIt is also possible to classify lipoproteins as alpha and beta, akin to the classification of proteins in serum protein electrophoresis. This terminolgy is sometimes used in describing lipid disorders such as Abetalipoproteinemia.\n\nThat's My Best Answer!

__label__5 , colour of bitmap?,,A raster graphics image, digital image, or bitmap, is a data file or structure representing a generally rectangular grid of pixels, or points of color, on a computer monitor, paper, or other display device. The color of each pixel is individually defined; images in the RGB color space, for instance, often consist of colored pixels defined by three bytes—one byte each for red, green and blue. Less colorful images require less information per pixel;\n\nan image with only black and white pixels requires only a single bit for each pixel. Raster graphics are distinguished from vector graphics in that vector graphics represent an image through the use of geometric objects such as curves and polygons.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap

__label__3 , how do you cure period pains?,,There isn't really a cure but rasberries help. warm water too
__label__3 , How does asprin or tylenol work to make headaches go away?,,Aspirin helps these problems by stopping cells from making prostaglandins. Remember the enzyme, COX-2?  It is a protein made by your body's cells whose job is to take chemicals floating around in your tissues and turn them into prostaglandins.  \nCOX-2 can be found in lots of normal tissues, but much more of it is made in tissue that has been damaged in some way. Aspirin, it turns out, sticks to COX-2 and won't let it do its job; it's like a lock you put on your bicycle.  The bicycle won't move with the lock on, and COX-2 can't work with aspirin stuck in it.  So by taking aspirin, you don't stop the problem that's causing the pain, like the tight muscles in your scalp, or the cramping in your abdomen, or the hammer-damaged finger.  But it does lower the volume on the pain signals getting through your nerves to your brain. \n\nOne common question about aspirin and other medicines is, How does it know how to get to where the pain is?  The answer is that it doesn't! When you take aspirin, it dissolves in your stomach or the next part of the digestive tract, the small intestine, and your body absorbs it there. Then it goes into the bloodstream and it goes through your entire body. Although it is everywhere, it only works where there are prostaglandins being made, which includes the area where it hurts.  \n\nYou may ask, How come I have to keep taking aspirin if it works so well?  As with almost all chemicals, your body has ways of getting rid of aspirin.  In this case, your liver, stomach, and other organs change aspirin to... surprise! Salicylic acid!  This chemical then slowly gets changed a bit more by the liver, which sticks other chemicals onto the salicylic acid so that your kidneys can filter it out of your blood and send it out in your urine. This whole process takes about four to six hours, so you need to take another pill at that time to keep the effect going. \n\nThe problem with the fact that aspirin goes through your entire bloodstream is that your body needs prostaglandins for some reasons.  One place they are useful is in the stomach; it turns out another enzyme called COX-1 makes a prostaglandin that seems to keep your stomach lining nice and thick.  Aspirin keeps COX-1 from working (it keeps most prostaglandins from being made equally well -- it's nonselective), and your stomach lining gets thin, allowing the digestive juice inside to irritate it.  This is probably the biggest reason why aspirin and its relatives upset stomachs (not only because it's an acid, as Hoffmann had thought).  \n\nCOX-2 also works in some normal tissues like the brain and kidney; at normal amounts, one dose of aspirin probably doesn't affect these areas much. And there are other places in the body where prostaglandins have a job in normal tissues, such as the blood..

When a human being consumes a bird flu virus infected Bird then he may get infected bird Flu.However if the Chicken is cooked above 80 degree Celsius temperature the virus is unable to sustain after  that temperature so even if you eat a bird flu infected bird but yet cook above 80 degree Celsius you will not catch Bird Flu.

__label__2 , what is the reason why on the basis of LEwis structures, the carbon atom in carbon monoxide can bind with hemo,,CO contains a coordinate covalent bond which allows it to bond with hemo(globin?) in much the same way O2 does, which also contains those bonds. \nCO2, is more stable and unreactive since it contains 2 double bonds. \nLewis structures show these different bonds by showing the sharing of the valence electrons among between the atoms of the CO molecule. Since simply sharing 2 of carbons 4 valence electrons completes the octet of the oxygen atom, it is satisfied. But the carbon atom is left, at this point, lacking two to comlete its octet. Other electrons help out to complete the process, but make for an unstable configuration, allowing the CO molecule to bond effectively with other molecules.

I was just wondering if they’re where any kinds of things I could do.,You should speak to your doctor. He/she can set you up with a nutrionalist who can advise you the best diet for your body type and current lifestyle. Also, the diet pills will only work correctly if used with proper diet & excersice. They are very easily missused, but they themselves are not bad, just the missuse is.
__label__3 , What do you do when excersise doesn't work?,Ok so I'm 17 and I weigh ...ok I'm a girl and I'm not telling, but a lot and I really need to lose weight. Not only do I need to but I'm a high school senior and winter formal, prom and graduation are right around the corner and I want to look great. But here's the thing, I try to hit the gym at least 4 times a week and I'll do about 45 mins of cardio and I'm slowly getting into the weights and machines like those but my weights not coming down. Not only that but I can't seem to actually stick to any plan I make for myself. Like I said, I'm only 17 so I'm really tight on money and there's no way I can get a personal trainer. I need to lose weight and I need to do it now. I'm hopping for 40 pounds my May. Is that too unrealistic and how can obtain my goal?,Sorry, this isn't really any help, but I have the same problem.. I've been doing regular exercise, including weight training and cardio for months, with a personal trainer that I see every two weeks, and I haven't lost an ounce! My trainer says I'm probably losing fat and gaining muscle weight, and the same goes for you I'm sure, but any addiitonal weightloss has to come from a healthy diet and drinking lots of water, according to my trainer! Good luck, I know how hard it is!!!

If they are girls, they may even be interested in shopping for themselves, so maybe a giftcard to a childrens clothing store.\n\n-EA

Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.), who is head of the \nCongressional Immigration Reform Caucus,\n \nMassive immigration of low-skilled, low-wage workers ... \ndepresses wage rates for people who are at the low economic end of the scale. ... \nThe overall effect will be the decline of the living standard of every American, \nor most Americans.\n\nAccording to TNRIP, the financial cost of this foreign invasion to U.S. taxpayers \nis staggering!

__label__2 , why the date of perhelion distance and the date of shortest day is not same?,date of perhelion and date of shortest day reason, orbit of earther,because it is not the distance from the sun that makes out day but how the earth is tilted.\nThe Earth is tilted by 23 1/2 degrees. During the Summer months, \nthe north is pointed toward the Sun allowing more direct sunlight. \nDuring the winter, we are tilted away from the sun so the sunlight \nis more indirect as the sun seems lower in the sky. \nThere are 4 cardinal points in our calender; \nSummer solstice, autumnal equinox, winter solstice and vernal equinox. \nBeginning of summer, fall, winter and spring. This coincides \nwith the position of earth as it goes around the sun. \nEach of the cardinal days can take place over a three day period,\n 20th, 21st, 22nd. On June 22nd, summer solstice, it is the longest \nday of the year. It is also the day that the north pole is pointing \ndirectly at the sun. The next day it will have passed this point \nand start pointing away from the sun, hence, the days will also start \ngetting shorter. For further info, \nfeel free to email me, orion_1812@yahoo.com

Have you had an exam at a gynocologist?  You should have an exam and also a pap smear.  The pain on your right side could be from the constipation, straining or possibly a pocket in the intestine.  You need to drink more water and make sure you eat or drink fruits/juices/veggies that will make you go to the bathroom better.  The discomfort in the abdomen may be from not going to the bathroom right.  Try drinking a 12 ounce of cranberry juice a day, that will help you alot to go if your not a veggie eater.  Any fruits or fruit drinks, natural ones, will help too.

__label__9 , this is a modified question to what i asked earlier.?,my girlfriend dumped me last night. we was in a long distance relationship for 8 years. keep in mind that i barely \ntalk to her and she hasnt called me in weeks. her reason for dumping me was that i made her feel unappreciated and\ni strung her along and i decieved her and she has all this anger towards me and all she thinks about is how much i\nhave constantly hurt her. she also said that i cant make her happy anymore and told me to find someone else. but the\nstrange thing is, i am like the nicest guy you could ever meet. i never cheated on her, i was always repectful to her\nnever put my hands on her, was always there for her when she needed help. as recently as 2 months ago she needed\nsome help , so i sent her some money to help her out. i always told her that i loved her and missed her and was workin\nhard to try and save up so we could be together. but she claims that i hurt her soo much???..it dont make sense.\n\nwhen we first met she begged me not to leave her and i didn't.,The same thing happened to me, however, the answer is pretty much one thing.  Your presence was required.  She needed and wanted you there to be there for her on a daily basis.  I know the whole ordeal and situation with money, but just as money can't buy you love, you can't survive without money.  Unfortunately, the presence of a person on a daily basis is really and very important, and I think she's hurt because neither one of you two has managed to be together for about 8 years and that's a long time.  It's not your fault and it's not her fault, but why so long is a good question to ask.  \n\nThis is what distance and time apart does to people.  Sometimes people have too much time to think and their imagination runs wild.  She is angry, but more at the separation and distance than at you.  Everything has a time and place and in her own way she is saying and telling you that you can't deal with the pain of being apart so long and any longer.  Once again, it's not your fault, it's just the way things are when two people are apart for such a long time.  The bottom line is and was that your presence was required and you couldn't be there for economic reasons.  Trust me, love doesn't care about money.  \n\nYou didn't hurt her, but she was definitely hurt by your absence.  It is just another way of saying that she really, really missed you.  Unfortunately, people can only wait so long to have somebody at their side regardless of how responsible and caring you might have been at a distance.  I know it's hard and it doesn't make sense, but keep in mind that she is blaming you for not being there for her when she physically needed your presence.  Remember, it's not your fault, but those are some of the consequences of time apart and distance.

__label__1 , Am I bisexual or lesbian?,Umm...I only fantazise aloT bout gurls, but a little about boiz. I think gurls r gd 4 sex and for love too...But I seem to think about boiz in a more romantic and loving way. It seems like gurls attract me more than boys, sexually and sometimes in love, but boiys only attract me by their sweetness, not body nor nothing... I seem to turn down guyz too much, but open wit gurls, but STILL like guys....So, AM I BISEXUAL? OR LESBIAN?,If you have ever seen something called the Kinsey Scale, it describes people who are mostly attracted to one sex and somewhat attracted to the other. Judging by everything you say here, it really can't be said what, of those two labels, you are. You seem to find women more sexually attractive, but men more romantically interesting. Frankly, I think you are putting too much stock in the label. While I know it can be hard not having a set identity, you should just be with someone who you find BOTH sexually and romantically interesting and who treats you right, whether they are a man or a woman. If you really need a label for your peace of mind, I would say you are bisexual, but you are also rather young, give yourself time to figure yourself out. You already understand one point better than most. You know it is not all about sex and sexual attraction, otherwise you would have settled this question a while ago. Just give yourself time, you don't need to know every last little thing about yourself by the time you finish high school, trust me.

__label__9 , What is difference between LOVE, INFATUATION, and LUST?,,First I'd have to examine the similarities. They are all, most likely, what was once simply the instinct to procreate.  \n\nThese words are symbols like all words, the concepts they represent to us are broad and almost undefinable.  For instance, there are many different flavors of love.  This really means that the word love actually covers many different concepts that have similarities but are not identical (brotherly love, a mother's love, romantic love).  Likewise when one is infatuated with a new band, it means something quite different from when one is infatuated with a person.\n\nHow they have become different would perhaps be related to the varying stages of a romantic relationship.   At first there is lust, it is strongly driven by hormones making it feel like raw primal desire.  If you continue to see the person you may become infatuated with them, meaning that thinking about the person consumes most of your attention, all day.  This phase is terribly distracting, every other second you find the person popping into your head.  Finally, if you keep spending time with the person you may develop love, a deep caring for their wellbeing and an emotional attachment that would hurt you if it were broken.  At this point it becomes more similar to familiar love like a mother and child, but retains a certain amount of lustiness and infatuation.  In a good relationship, the partners both work to keep love, infatuation and lust strong.

__label__1 , Are all Seventh Day Adventist's vegetarian's?,,The simple answer: no. I know this because am one (SDA and vegetarian) and I work in a vegetarian restaurant and health-food store. I would say a large number do not consume meats that are unclean according to the Biblical guidelines (see Leviticus 11:1-30), while they will eat those considered clean meats, such as chicken and beef. From my experience though, the greater majority do claim to be total vegetarian.\n\nNo, all SDA's aren't vegetarian. But they are known for it partly because, yes, a large number of them really are!\n\nCheck out www.sdada.org/position.htm for more info.

__label__2 , How do anti-retroviral drugs work without affecting our own cells and RNA?,,If they are anti-retroviral, they target reverse transcriptase.  Reverse transcriptase is the enzyme which converts ssRNA to dsDNA.  \n\nI recall being taught that human cells do not have any reverse transcriptase, and that's why these drugs should work.\n\nHowever, I also recall picking up later the fact that there is some reverse transcriptase activity in humans (one paper is referenced below).\n\nThat being said, viral RTase activity will be way higher than human telomerase (the subject of the paper referenced below), since most of our cells are typically non-dividing.  So targetting RTase activity still works because the viral enzyme is extremely active, and the virus will be greatly disrupted by blocking its activity.  Wheras the human RTase is normally inactive, and non-replicating cells don't need it.

__label__1 , Why don't people start studying the Bible instead of asking stupid questions about religious subjects?,Don't they know that the Bible contains all the answers to their questions??,Get of your self rightous high horse and stop to realize that in order to learn, one must ask questions. You were not born educated in the word of God. You I'm sure asked many questions when you were wanting to learn about God. Where did you misplace your humility.\n\nIt's an attitude like yours that runs off the lost soul who is seeking out God's truth, and their salvaion through His truth. If they percieve all Chrsitians to spout off like you just did, they would not want to become a Chrisitan for fear of becoming like someone like you. And who could blame them?\n\nYou not only must obtain knowledge through the word of God, but you must adopt those very words into your being and behave as an ambassador of God. What you said in your post was ugly and rude and not the way God wants us to teach others.\n\n Proverbs 15:33 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility \n\nDid it ever occur to you that other people may be getting spiritually fed from the answers that are given to those who ask questions that you feel are not worthy of yoru time to answer them?

__label__4 , could you give me information on indians living in sri lanka?,example-their festivals, the clothes they wear & the food they eat,When I lived in Sri Lanka (15 years ago) there where many festivals. What they were depended upon the time of year, the caste membership and/or the religion of the participants.  There is the veneration of the Bodhi-tree, another one of the religious festivals of Sri Lanka is Vesak, it commemorates the birth of Buddha. They celebrate their National New Year Aluth Avurudhu in Sinhala and Puththandu in Tamil.\nOther festivals and ceremonies depend, again upon if the people are living in the hills, seashore or elsewhere.  The clothes for many are the same as the western world.  Many women wear saris/sarees.  They are wrapped in a special manner and are beautiful. The men sometimes wear business suits, cotton is the best fabric and you might see them wear a white sarong and a white shirt that comes almost down to the knees. As far as foods, mostly I remember a lot of rice! But many people from many lands have lived in and settled in Sri Lanka-- you can find foods of many origins--even burgers and fries. I remember the local colas were good and I loved the flat bread made from chick-pea flour.
__label__2 , who invented the bell jar?,,Google bell jar and you find out lots about Sylvia Plath but not much about chemistry...\nThe bell jar was probably not an invention in the usual sense of the word.  Bell jars were in use by alchemists in the middle ages (way before A. G. Bell), and may well date back much further.  Alchemy is believed to have started about 2000 BC in Egypt, although China, India and Arab cultures were also early practitioners.

__label__4 , How to get a journal article photocopied and sent to me.?,I need to get an old journal article (1922) for my research.  This is not a journal that every university library will have (Architect and Engineer, published in San Francisco).  Is there some service that will retrieve this article for me?  For a moderate price?  I am not a current university student, so I cannot use 'interlibrary loan' (well at least I don't think I can).,Yes, that's a good idea.  Even though you aren't a student, interlibrary loan might be available to you since you are a member of the community.\n\nAlternately, you might contact the library that holds the journal and see if they will allow you to pay for that service.

I dated this one guy who was 17 years older than me, it was kinda weird when he’d talk about serving in the military… cuz I would think… “I was in diapers.” He’d ask if I remembered when.. then stop because he had realized I wasn’t even born yet.

He doesn't want us to summarize what the 12th amendment says or what happened in 1800. He just wants us to answer the question if anyone knows what that means. This guy is tough.,Prior to the 12th, whomever received the most electoral votes was president and whomever received the next largest number was vice-president. In 1796, the president and vice-president elect were from different parties, causing some difficulties in governing. In the election of 1800, the candidates for president and vice-president received the exact same number of votes and caused a run-off election in the House of Representatives. The 12th allowed candidates to run as a president and vice-president team specifying which office each candidate sought and was electable to.

__label__6 , question for argeintina football fans?,whos best crespo or tevez? i think tevez,No doubt that both fantastic players.\n\nHernan Crespo is a typical penalty box striker and there are not too many players who play this position better than the Argentine striker.\n\nCarlos Carlito Teves is an altogether different type of striker, he plays in a role similar to Wayne Rooney and links the midfield play to the attack.\n\nCrespo has still got what it takes , But Teves is is only going to get better.\nFor me Teves just wins it.\n\nBut the debate about the best Argentine player at the moment has to be between the FANTASTIC Juan Roman Riquelme and  the BOY WONDER Lionel Messi

Only at the very end of the robo-call does it identify itself as having been sent by the Republicans. The idea is to infuriate voters with late-night harrassing calls and make them think the Democrats are behind it.\n\nAll of this abuse makes me think political robo-calls in general should be banned.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nSOURCE: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/06/AR2006110601103_pf.html,they should be banned \nand legal action should be taken against them

__label__4 , How do you call this mark : @  ?,I wonder what @ is called in English.\n\nBut it would be interesting to know it in other languages too, which  you talk.,*History*\nThe @ sign may have evolved from the Norman French à\n\n@ appears to be the cursive form of ā, an abbreviation of an unknown word beginning with a. In medieval European manuscripts, abbreviations were generally indicated by drawing a line over or through the letters, as in the common IX for Jesus Christ, or # from lb for libra 'pound'. In the typeface of the Gutenberg Bible, ā stands for either an or am within words. However, it is not known which particular word gave rise to modern @.\n\nA commonly accepted theory is that the symbol is derived from the Latin preposition ad, which means about with numerals. However, no document showing this usage has been presented.\n\nA similar idea is that @ is the abbreviation of the Greek preposition ana (ανά), which means 'at the rate of' when used with numerals, exactly its modern commercial usage.\n\nA more recent idea has been proposed by Giorgio Stabile, a professor of history in Rome. He claims to have traced the symbol back to the Italian Renaissance in a Venetian mercantile document signed by Francesco Lapi on May 4, 1536. The document talks about commerces with Pizarro and in particular the price of an @ of wine in Peru, where <@> stood for amphora (Italian anfora; Spanish and Portuguese arroba). The word arroba still means both the @ symbol and a unit of weight (see below). Under this view, the symbol was used to represent one amphora, which was a unit of weight or volume based upon the capacity of the standard terracotta jar, and came into use with the modern meaning at the rate of in northern Europe.\n\nHowever, @ could be the abbreviation of any word beginning in a, and more than one such symbol was likely in use, but there is no continuous record between any of the possibilities and the modern symbol.\n\nAn alternative view is that it derives from Norman French à meaning at in the sense of each. 2 widgets à £5.50 = £11.00 is the sort of accountancy shorthand notation you will see on English commercial vouchers and ledgers all the way into the 1990s, where the usage was superseded for accountants with its e-mail usage. It is used in this way in Modern French also.\n\nAccording to this view, the @ symbol is simply a stylish way of writing the à, so as not to remove the hand from the page in making the symbol. You can see hybrids between @ and à in French handwriting in street markets to this day.\n\n*Modern uses*\nThe symbol's most familiar modern use is in e-mail addresses (sent by SMTP), as in jdoe@example.com (the user named ‘jdoe’ working at the computer named ‘example’ in the ‘com’ domain). Ray Tomlinson is credited with the introduction of this use in 1972. This idea of user@host is seen in many other tools and protocols as well: for example, the command ssh jdoe@www.example.com would try to establish a ssh connection to the box with the hostname www.example.com using the username jdoe.\n\nIn the programming language Perl, the symbol prefixes variables which contain arrays, as opposed to scalar values (indicated with '$') and hash tables / associative arrays ('%'). If the code were to be treated as a sentence, this prefix would be the equivalent of a determiner, so @animals might be read as these animals.\n\nIn the IRC protocol, @ is the symbol for a channel operator. IRC also uses the user@host form (often preceded by nick!) for identifying and banning users. In this case the user@ part was originally an ident response and the host part was a reverse dns name from the user's IP. However, most modern IRC networks provide some mechanism for users to hide their real reverse dns hostname and/or for admins/privileged users to pick one arbitrarily.\n\nThe @ character is also used as an alternative political spelling for typing in some Romance languages as a gender-neutral substitute for the

Certain kinds of mental illnesses make someone not responsible but should their past come to play in it as well?  Or how they were treated as children?  Have we become a society that now makes excuses for everything someone might do? Where is the line drawn as to what constitues a reason and what makes it an excuse? How do we shift it back, if it needs to be, from this point and bring back personal responisbility?,I do feel we are a society that has come to make excuses for everything and responsibilty falls to the waste side.  Either that or we just pass the blame along til we forget what the blame is.  If you have a clean cut case.  He killed her with a gun in the lobby.  Its simple.  He goes to jail.  Case closed.  But when it comes to the tougher issues.  He killed her with a gun in the lobby but he has been on meds since 85 for an illness he cant help and some one forgot to remind him to take it.  Thats where blame gets passed along like a basketball.  Do we blame him or blame the person who forgot to remind him to take the meds that keep him balanced.  \nIn my honest opinion we have become a society who is weak.  We look for the easy way out.  We dont look at the source of the problem.  We assume that either the man or the caregiver of the mentally ill is responsible.  We do not look at the illness and say, how could we have helped him better before this happened.  We dont want to take the hard cases.  And so the ball keeps going around the court.

For example, play miniature golf, go parasailing, ride a roller coaster, something like that. When you share experiences -- especially ones with an element of fear, like parasailing and roller coasters -- you make a deeper connection and are less stiff and nervous. You can get to know each other better more quickly.\n\nIf you want to eat afterward, probably somewhere a little nicer than usual.

Person number two is right, you are looking for a forgiving flex, the degree to which it is soft for you is determined by your weight.  So don’t go out and get a super soft ski unless you weigh ninety pounds. I would suggest a low level salomon scrambler 5, 6, or 7 series, or the K2 omni 4.5 to 5.5. These will last you a couple of years and offer significant value and performance.

__label__8 , What do you think of this joke? read on! You want regret it if you read it, trust me. what do you think??,Pocket Taser Stun Gun, a great gift for the wife.\n \nThis was submitted by a guy who purchased his lovely wife a pocket Taser for their anniversary.\n\nLast weekend I saw something at Larry's Pistol & Pawn Shop that sparked my interest.  The occasion was our 22nd anniversary and I was looking for a little something extra for my wife Toni.  What I came across was a 100,000-volt, pocket/purse-sized taser.  The effects of the taser were suppose to be short lived, with no long-term adverse affect on your assailant, allowing her adequate time to retreat to safety....\nWAY TOO COOL!\n\nLong story short, I bought the device and brought it home.  I loaded two triple-a batteries in the darn thing and pushed the button. Nothing!  I was disappointed.  I learned, however, that if I pushed the button AND pressed it against a metal surface at the same time; I'd get the blue arch of electricity darting back and forth between the prongs. Awesome!!! Unfortunately, I have yet to explain to Toni what that burn spot is on the face of her microwave.\n\nOkay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself that it couldn't be all that bad with only two triple-a batteries,... right?\n\nThere I sat in my recliner, my cat Gracie looking on intently (trusting little soul) while I was reading the directions and thinking that I really needed to try this thing out on a flesh & blood moving target.  I must admit I thought about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of a second) and thought better of it.  She is such a sweet cat.  But, if I was going to give this thing to my wife to protect herself against a mugger, I did want some assurance that it would work as advertised.  Am I wrong?\n\nSo, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a tank top with my reading glasses perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in one hand, taser in another.  The directions said that a one-second burst would shock and disorient your assailant; a two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a major loss of bodily control; a three-second burst would purportedly make your assailant flop on the ground like a fish out of water.  Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting the batteries.\n\nAll the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5 long, less than 3/4 inch in circumference; pretty cute really and loaded with two itsy, bitsy triple-a batteries) thinking to myself, no possible way!\n\nWhat happened next is almost beyond description, but I'll do my best.......\n\nI'm sitting there alone, Gracie looking on with her head cocked to one side as to say, don't do it master, reasoning that a one-second burst from such a tiny little ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad.... I decided to give myself a one-second burst just for the heck of it. I touched the prongs to my naked thigh, pushed the button, and HOLY MOTHER, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION!!!\n\nI'm pretty sure Jessie Ventura ran in through the side door, picked me up in the recliner, then body slammed us both on the carpet, over and over and over again.  I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, with tears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles nowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest position, and tingling in my legs.  The cat was standing over me making meowing sounds I had never heard before, licking my face, undoubtedly thinking to herself, do it again, do it again!\n\nNote: If you ever feel compelled to mug yourself with a taser, one note of caution: there is no such thing as a one-second burst when you zap yourself.  You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a violent thrashing about on the floor.  A three second burst would be considered conservative.\n\nSON-OF-A-.... that hurt like hell!!!\n\nA minute or so later (I can't be sure, as time was a relative thing at th,LOL!! That was one of the funniest stories I've heard in a long time. I like best the part where the guy burst out into saying HOLY MOTHER, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION!! LOL!!
__label__3 , Can people with celiac disese have spelt?,,Nope... Wheat, barley, rye, oats, spelt, semolina, triticale, and kamut are on the no-no list for Celiacs. If you're looking at expanding your grain intake, try corn or masa, quinoa, rice, and buckwheat. If you're simply looking for a gluten free grain to use in baking try a mixture of white rice flour, potato starch flour, tapioca starch, and xantham gum. If you're looking for a bread to substitute for gluten-containing breads, try ordering online at www.kinnikinnick.com, the tapioca rice bread is decent when toasted. I personally prefer using Mission corn tortillas instead of bread. Only Mission brand taste good and are flexible enough to make a sandwich out of them (after microwaving, of course). For bread, you may also be interested in trying Gluten Free Pantry's Sandwich Bread. You need a breadmaker to make it, but it's worth the hassle.

__label__6 , What the does word Ashes mean in Cricket?,When it comes to the Ashes it is a huge thing in Cricket, why is that?,The Ashes is a Test cricket series, played between England and Australia - it is international cricket's oldest and most celebrated rivalry dating back to 1882. It is currently played approximately biennially, alternately in England and Australia. The Ashes are held by the country which last won a series and to regain them the other country must win more Test matches in a series than the country that holds them. If a series is drawn then the country holding the Ashes retains them. The last Ashes series was played in England in 2005 when England regained The Ashes after a gap of 16 years by winning the series 2-1. The next Ashes series will be in Australia in 2006-07 and the next series in England will be in 2009.\n\nThe series is named after a satirical obituary published in The Sporting Times in 1882 following the match at The Oval, in which Australia beat England in England for the first time. The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia. The English media dubbed the next English tour, to Australia (1882-83) as the quest to regain The Ashes.\n\nA small terracotta urn was presented to the England captain Ivo Bligh by a group of Melbourne women at some point during the 1882-83 tour. The contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of an item of cricket equipment, possibly a bail, ball or stump. The urn is not used as a trophy for the Ashes series, and whichever side holds the Ashes, the urn normally remains in the MCC Museum at Lord's because of its age and fragility] Since the 1998-99 Ashes series, a Waterford crystal trophy has been presented to the winners.\n\nIf you want to know more about Ashes Series, please check the following website:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashes

__label__5 , I need to detect all the MAC numbers of a wireless LAN that I not a member of, can I?,,Yes you can.  Download Netstumbler and Ethereal (both free) and give those a try.  Ethereal is a freeware Sniffer, and depending on your wireless network card's internal chipset, you may or may not be able to sniff the lower level wireless frames, which would have MAC addresses, SSIDs, and everything else too.  But try NetStumbler first, it works great, and it will detect all other wireless LANs in your proximity and tell you what channel they're on (so you can detect if a neighbor is interfering with you) and if they have security turned on, etc.  Say for example you see your neighbor on channel 6 (common default) and their signal strength is good, then you can change your AP to channels 1 or 11 to minimize interference.
__label__1 , Which Religion is associated with the highest number of human casualities/fatalities:?,Christianity\nIslam\nSecular/Agnostic/Atheist\nHinduism\nBuddhism\nChinese folk religion\nPrimal indigenous\nAfrican traditional and diasporic\nSikhism\nJuche\nSpiritism\nJudaism\nMormonism\nBahá'í Faith\nJehovah's Witnesses\nJainism\nShinto\nCao Dai\nZoroastrianism\nTenrikyo\nNeopaganism\nUnitarian\nRastafari\nNote: Borrowed from the Religion Wiki list,This is actually a tough question. Judism was responsible for millions of deaths pre Christianity and in Christianities early days.\n\nPeople keep talking about the Holucost of the Jews, but there was an even bigger and longer Holucost then this one that you don't hear that often. For the first about 800 yrs of Christianity, Christians were hunted. Yes the Christian holucost was far worse then that of the Jews.\n\nThen on the other hand, you have the Christians, which were responsible for the crusades, the Jewish holucost, burnings of witches, not to mention in some countries they persecuted you for not being Christian.\n\nBut, my answer would still be the Jews.\n\nWith that being said, both of these religions bad times were in the past. Niether one is truely bad today. Although there are some wars that state religion as a cause for them today; this is truelly not the case.\n\nFor instance, if you were to go up to the Pope and ask him what he thinks about a war caused by Christianity?

__label__5 , What is MySQL?,What is MySQL? What is it used for? Is it complicated? Help!,MySQL is a popular open source SQL (Structured Query Language) database implementation, available for many platforms, including Windows, Unix/Linux and Mac OS X.\n\nMySQL is a relational database management system, which means it stores data in separate tables rather than putting all the data in one big area. This adds flexibility, as well as speed. The SQL part of MySQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is the most common language used to access databases. The MySQL database server is the most popular open source database in the world. It is extremely fast and easy to customize, due to its architecture. Extensive reuse of code within the software, along with a minimalist approach to producing features with lots of functionality, gives MySQL unmatched speed, compactness, stability, and ease of deployment. Their unique separation of the core server from the storage engine makes it possible to run with very strict control, or with ultra fast disk access, whichever is more appropriate for the situation.

__label__6 , WHAT WILL BE THE SCORE FOR HOLLAND vs IVORY COAST?,,First off, for the previous answer, the Ivory Coast didn't play Germany in the first round.  Ivory Coast played Argentina and Germany played Costa Rica.\n\nThat being said, Argentina did win the game, but the Ivory Coast played incredibly well.  They moved the ball as well or better than any team I've seen play yet.  They did lose, but the Argentinian goals were nearly all counter attacks.  They didn't build up anything and score a technical goal.  They are a good team, but they didn't impress me against the Ivory Coast, and that says a lot because of the FIFA rankings.\n\nNow, for the Dutch.  The Dutch are a hell of a team.  Robben played better in the game against Serbia & Montenegro than any player I've seen yet.  The Dutch have an excellent squad this year; however, they're young.  When you bring back a team that's lost the likes of Bergkamp, Davids, Cluivert, and Van Baasten, you'll be looking for leadership.  With Van Nistelrooy up top, you've got a lot, but still, they'll be lacking in that department.\n\nAll this being said, I think the game will be really close, but I think the Dutch will edge it out.  I'll say 2-1 or 3-2 in favor of Holland.

Most likely though you need more protein in your diet.  Using a high protein supplement is good like the powder shake stuff you can get at GNC.

__label__9 , I just found out about my fiance's addiction to internet porn, only BDSM, will this ruin our marriage?,He says he thinks about it all the time (BDSM) like different ways to tie me up and other things he'd like to do to me,  and uses the computer whenever he's alone. Once in a while I let him do those things, but I'm not into that stuff and it doesn't turn me on, also sometimes it hurts. I've tried to be accomodating to what he's into, letting him know that just cuz I'm not into it, doesn't mean I think he's a freak (he spent many years before me thinking he wasn't normal because of it). We've been together 3 years and only recently has this become a problem. He says his only been this obsessed about it for about a month, that before then it was only like twice a month (which I kinda knew before and was fine with since I have my own things I'm into and would indulge in on the net about that often as well). But I don't know what to do now, it's excessive. He wants to get help. I'm scared that this is going to ruin our marriage, and that he won't be able to change, even though he wants to.,The first rule is to not let him do anything to you that you do not approve of. It's fine if you accomodate him at times, but only if you are comfortable with it. If he tries anything that makes you uncomfortable, do not let him get away with it.\n\nConcerning his addiction, it sounds like it's fueling his interest instead of satiating it. With that said, it does sound like there is a rough road ahead. Obviously this is something that needs to come out into the open and soon. (I mean a real serious talk, maybe in a consuling session.)\n\nFinally, I'm glad that you are not perceiving this as something amoral in him, because it's not. The urges are there and that will change over time. As long as you are comfortable with what he does with those urges, things should be fine. It sounds like you're afraid that you may be uncomfortable at some point in the near future. That's what consuling and openness will have to work on.
__label__10 , I am a british citizen and want my girl frend who is russian to live with me?,She is living in Canada i want her to come over to the uk and live with me we want to get marred.what do i need to do to get her over hear and to stay,She would need to apply for a spouse visa, which would be valid for two years. At the end of that time, if you are still together and she hasn't needed any form of public assistance (benefits, council housing, etc) then she should get settlement here.\n\nIf your beloved is legally resident in Canada, and you can show that you can accommodate her, etc, you'll probably be OK. If she's there illegally, you may have problems! If she's there on a temporary basis, they'll treat her as if she's applying from Russia, ie skeptically, I should think.\n\nAnyway, I think she could apply at the British High Commission in Canada, she'll probably be called there for an interview, where they'll look at her documentation, and question her about the nature of her relationship with you.\n\nLook, I'm not an immigration advisor, so check out the Home Office website www.homeoffice.gov.uk, and get some free advice from somewhere like a CAB or Law Centre - it's really important not to get these things wrong, and the law is changing all the time.\n\nBy the way, if she comes here on some other visa, eg tourist visa, she will NOT be allowed to marry you here. So check it all out first.\n\nGood luck!
__label__3 , my daughter was cut on her hand and developed a bruise about 2 inches down on her wrist, are these related?,,It's possible that what you call a bruise is really blood from the hand wound pooling up in the wrist.  It would be difficult to tell the difference without a professional test or two.  If she experiences painful tenderness when touched on the wrist, then it's most likely an unrelated bruise.  Blood pooling from another injury site might not be especially painful.\n\nKeep an eye on it, and seek medical attention if the bruised area grows larger or doesn't seem to heal on its own.  There could be another injured vein or artery in the hand.

__label__3 , Can a yeast infection cause one to be infertile?,I recently had a UTI and I was left with a yeast infection from the antibiotics.\n\nCan I still become pregnant if I have an yeast infection?\n\nAlso, I was wondering everytime I have sex with a certain male the next morning I have a thick gluey discharge.  Does anyone know what this may be?,1. An ordinary yeast infection cannot cause infertility.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't treat it, as it is communicable and unpleasant.  Your doctor can prescribe diflucan, or you can take an over-the-counter medication like Monistat which should clear it up in a few days.\n\n2. Yes you can still get pregnant if you have a yeast infection.  You are also more vulnerable to STDs, as your vagina is irritated and susceptible to tearing.\n\n3. Are you not using a condom?  It could be semen, or it could be  that you are ovulating (thick gluey discharge is classic ovulation mucus).  If you're concerned, you need to see a doctor for this one, since internet diagnosis is notoriously unreliable.

__label__9 , Does she have interest or not!?,I met a girl last year by chance, we ran into each other and talked breifly. I walked away having a good feeling about it and later on found that she was a friend of one of my best friend. \nI met her again later that year and we hung with some other girls and that was around the time I became aware I was heavily crushing on her. The girl in question is extremely flirty and nice to /everyone/. She holds doors open for me, hangs back for me, and has commented on me being sexy. We have danced together and get along fairly well. She will randomly touch my arm at times, and definately isnt shy about being close or giving me kisses on the cheek or forehead or even about touching me or telling me I am cute and sweet. But she is popular and has a lot of girls after her! Is she just being friendly because she is a friendly person? Does she like me or no? I don't feel as attractive compared to her! So I don't believe she could be interested in me since she is out of my league. I am also a girl,okay first, it's been tested and proven that no one is out of anyone's league.  Two, the best thing you can do is call her out on her bull.  If she's for real about her flirtation and wants in on your action, then you have something.  If not, move on and either keep her as a friend or drop her.  good luck in any case hon.

__label__1 , What is the worst thing you have done, that your affraid might haunt you and ruin your future?,you don't have to tell me what it is if you don't want to.\n\nBut please explain why would you be scared and what would do or give up to undo what has been done.\n\nThere's so many things I've done in the past, but this one thing, I would give up my soul or life or humanity to undo what I did to these people. \n\nWhat's your story?,I abandoned someone I loved and who loved me when the person most needed me. I have never really forgiven myself for what I did. I worry that a situation will occur that I can't deal with and will leave again. So I wonder if I can trust myself or if others can trust me. This one act has affected me for thirty years. I should have gotten counseling a long time ago, so I could forgive myself and move on. You sound really hurt by what you did, so you did not screw up because you don't care about other people. People can do really bad things, see the light, and learn better ways of taking care of themselves and others. You can't change the past, so get help, find ways to forgive yourself, seek, if you can, the forgiveness of the people you hurt, and try not to be so stupid, selfish, or out of control (whatever fits) in the future. The only thing you need to give up is your identification of yourself as a bad person. Practice trying to think about what you are doing and whether it's the right thing. My way of deciding ethical questions is simple: what would the world be like if everybody did what (ever) I am contemplating doing? If it is not a place I would want to be, I don't do it. Please find help (if you don't have money, try county mental health). See a priest or rabbi, talk to your mom or a favorite relative, see a doctor - do something. If what you did is related to drugs or alcohol, you may be able to get help through AA. Talk to someone so you can get perspective of what happened. You don't have to be afraid, it doesn't have to haunt you or ruin your future. Seek another path. Peace.

__label__6 , when striking down on a golf ball with an iron how far in front of the ball should your hands be?,,your hands should be slightly ahead of the ball . to allow your hands to zip thru at impact. also ball position is quite important . with the longer irons i.e. 2 , 3 etc you have a wider swing arc so the ball should be opposite inside of left heel and gradually move it slightly towards the centre of your stance as you progress thru the irons , so that when playing a 9 iron or wedge the ball should be roughly middle of your stance . golden rule is never swing too fast or try and hit the ball too hard take an extra club and don,t get involved in macho duels with your playing partners !! if he hits a 7 there,s no shame in hitting a 6 as long as it get,s the required result . you have a bag of 14 clubs , and it,s irrelevant whether you hit the green with a 9 or a 7 the score on the card is what matters !   enjoy !!!!

Whenever I wear new rings(anything except gold or platinum) they start to corrode and pit.  Sometimes they even turn black on the inside and anywhere they touch my skin.  Same thing for my dad.  \nOccasionally they'll even turn my fingers green(my husband and I bought matching engraved rings at Disney; mine turned black and my finger green and his was fine).  \nAll my earrings have to be for sensitive ears or they get infected and the holes get black around the edges.\nAnyone know why this happens or what causes it?,High acidity in sweat.
__label__9 , I need advice about a guy I am dating...?,When were together we have a great time. We have even discussed marriage, kids, etc. But because of work schedules we go a week a more without seeing each other. He has suggested moving in together so that we would have more time together. I can't do this because it is against my religion. I am 25, he is 36. I have 4 year old twins from my ex-husband and he has a 10 and 13 year old from his ex-wife. We live in the same city. What would you do? Do relationships like this work?,I think it very much depends on how long you have been going out.  both of you are from a relationship, and my worry is that the possible raison you want to move in together is because you both miss sex. Once a week is not too bad for a relationship!  My advice is to take some time before moving in together and I'm sure you would want to balance your religion with your personal life.  If you don't at the end you will get hurt and loose the confidence of your friends.
__label__9 , how to make my boyfriends become more mature?,,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! That's a good one.. *ahem* but seriously... Don't expect him to be more mature anytime soon. Just be happy with what you have and if you can't stand it then he's probably not the one for you
__label__10 , If a blood test reviels I'm not the father of a child, can I be freed of all obligations to that child?,,That question is not as straight-forward as you might imagine. Some states (like California where I practice) have presumed father' and putative father statutes. Basically, any child born of a marriage is PRESUMED to be that of the husband. You can defeat that presumption in a number of ways. HOWEVER, the time limit for rebutting that presumption is short. In California, I believe it's two years. After that time, the presumed father becomes the legal father forever. After that two years has passed, you could have proof positive that you're not the father and it wouldn't do a d#mn bit of good.

__label__3 , How can I get rid of razor burn on my legs?,Whenever I shave my legs I get little red bumps which I assume are razor burn.  Is there anything to get rid of or prevent them?,get rid of them:\nlet your skin heal, you're abusing yourself.\n\nprevent them:\nyou could try a dipilatory like neet but wait until after you've healed.  I've heard bad things about the type of hair removal systems that *pluck* your hair out.  If you're prone to ingrown hair you may want to avoid these and the dipilatory as well.  \n\nA lotion and an electronic razor may be your salvation.  They're smooth and don't cut deeply.  Your pantyhose may stick soon after shaving though but it won't look bad.\n\nGo natural?  Some men like that.  Whatever you do you'll adapt to your own body and learn what to do and when to balance being comfortable and presentable as well.  Heal first though, then try something that doesn't hurt you.  Eventually the razor burn will go away but leave your skin rougher and harder if you continue with what you're doing now.

You have to exercise for one hour every day and eat right.  Stop whining about how you can't keep with a diet.  It's your fault you are failing. You have to make a decision to eat right and exercise and then stick with it.  You want it to be easy so here's the trick.  Eat right and exercise.  Its that simple.  Take control and stop whining about why you fail. If you don't you will NEVER be healthy and you will never lose weight.

This is a country of Immigrants no?If faced with the same situation that many of the illegal immigrants face (no job,no food,corruption,hungry family,etc.) would you care if it was illegal to cross the border when you knew you were going to have a chance at a better life on the other side. And don't say  yes legally because its almost impossible to enter the country for work.The odds of getting a work visa for the US without a higher education is like getting struke by lighting 3 times in the same day.,I totally understand what you are saying and feel that if most people were faced with the same circumstances they would do the same thing. It is easy for people to judge when not in that situation and have such a good life here in our country. \n\nDon't judge any man until you have walked a mile in their shoes.\n\nAnd no one is saying that logically they can come here and break our laws and rob, steal, rape sell drugs etc because of their situations but what is the harm in them coming here to work? And it is true that Visa's are almost impossible to get.\n\nIt's not all cut & dry and that simple as people would like to think.

So when it's 25 degrees out, at the usual temperature of 32, the water freezes.  But when you add the salt to the roads, the water's freezing point drops below 32 degrees and thus, the ice melts.

Its unlikely that they are just going to come knocking on your door looking for you. If you are really serious about finding a girlfriend you're going to have to invest some time and actually date. You could try online like Yahoo Personals or meeting people out and about. If you really can't invest the time then just get yourself a prostitute.

Israel would be its true state because, like I said, the Jews would outnumber the Pakistanis and, if there was a religious war over the land, the Jews would win an easy battle. \n\nHmm... that's all I can think of at the moment, but it was a good idea.

That definately the first step and its definately the hardest step.

__label__2 , what are the differences between the nerve system and the electrical system ?,,Simply put: the nervous system is an electrical system.\n\nMore complexly put:  the nervous system is an electro-biochemical system where electrical signals are transported down the neuron to a synapse.  At the synapse, a chemical or hormone neurotransmitter is released.  This neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the nerve downstream, and activates an electrical current which continues to propagate to it's destination.\n\nThe difference between a functioning nerve and a functioning wire... functionally speaking... is none.  Structurally speaking, a wire is made of a conductive metal, surrounded by an insulating sheath of rubber or plastic.  A nerve cell, or neuron, stretches out long processes, called axons, to conduct electricity through the body.  It's insultation is provided by another type of cell, called the Schwann cell.  The Schwann cell, is composed of lipids (fats) which insulate the neuronal axon.

My wife inherited a share of a house which was valued for inheritance tax purposes. On sale of the house at a higher value, CGT became liable on the uplift in value from inheritance value to final sales value.\n\nI suppose if you recieved cash after inheritance tax then it is difficult to see that this would be subject to further tax, although any interest recieved if placed in savings, would be liable for income tax purposes...
__label__7 , What things do I need to start a small business?,I am looking to open a hobby store. I know what I want to sell and I know what clientel I am looking to serve, but what I need to know is a solid place to find grants, and other details like what I need to do go about getting a business license, leasing options, and distributors.,You need a lot of information. I suggest you read the following books:\n\n- What No One Ever Tells You About Starting Your Own Business: Real Life Start-Up Advice from 101 Successful Entrepreneurs  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1574101129/ref=nosim/powerhomebizguid \n- If You're Clueless About Starting Your Own Business and Want to Know More  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1574100939/ref=nosim/powerhomebizguid \n- Start Your Own Business : The Only Start-Up Book You'll Ever Need  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1891984217/ref=nosim/powerhomebizguid \n- Steps to Small Business Start-Up : Everything You Need to Know to Turn Your Idea into a Successful Business http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1574101323/ref=nosim/powerhomebizguid\n\nFor the licenses you need to your store, go to your Secretary of State website and look for information on how to start a business. That will contain the info you need and contact information\n\nIt is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on how to get grants or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\nThe U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.

We went into a debate that they were just faking it, is this even considered petrol sniffing? Their hands DID smell like petrol, but i didnt know what to say!,I doubt it.\n\nYou can get high off of smelling a permenent marker for hours.  Although some people like the smell of it, if they smell the marker, they aren't getting high, you need to REALLY work at it.  Same applies for this situation I believe.

__label__1 , If you found Latin easy to learn, how hard would you find learning other languages?,Specifically, Russian and Italian.,Congrats on your success with Latin.  70% of the Western Indo-European languages are based on Latin.  \n\nWhich means that all languages that were native to the European continent in times past are mostly derivative from the Latin language.\n\nThat to say, Italian is immersed in the Latin language. So is the French.  Russian is less so but I don't know a lot about the origin of Russian but it probably has more Eastern influence than Italian.\n\nEastern languages (e.g., Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hebrew, etc.) are more based in pictographic language forms (or pictures).  These are far from the Latin base of languages.
__label__8 , Who is/was the most influential singer/group in the United States in the past 15 years?,,The last 15 years? Well, that would either be Michael Jackson or Madonna. Both created their own unique sound and had many other artists in the past several years come out and try to be like them. For Michael, that would be Usher, Justin Timberlake, and the like. For Madonna that would be Britney Spears, Christina Aguiliera and the like. They were both massive pop icons in the 80's and 90's. While Michael has lost most of his American following due to his legal issues, he is still one of the top recording artists in European and Asian countries. Madonna, on the other hand, continues to re-invent herself with each new album. This is shown in her most recent release of Confessions on a Dance Floor. She's physically in the best shape she's been in for several years and her sound still makes people get up and move.

My girlfriend does a excellent job orally, but I can't have a orgasm. I tell her it's me not her, I guess i'm not use to it, never had a orgasm orally, but with her she does everthing right and I can't come. Why? What should I do? I get fustrated with myself, and she is so patient.,You should have her try inserting her fingers into you to stimulate your G spot while she pleases you orally.  This is probably the little extra you need.  Also, if that doesn't work, they do sell the part of the anatomy she is missing in a double header, you could try that.
__label__10 , How come almost every time a person criticizes conservatives in here, they are accused of being a Democrat?,That just wack. Liberal (the american sense of the word- not in the european economic sense of the word) and conservative are ideologies. Democrat and Republican are the parties that make up our two party system. A Democrat can be conservative (Dixiecrats) and a Republican can be liberal. And I in no way am a Democrat. I am not registered as one and do not plan to. I have no connection to the two corporate parties and their paymasters. I am a socialist and vote in that manner in almost all elections. And I also occasionally vote Libertarian. So any reply like, Clinton was a draft dodger or a aldulterer, etc. has nothing to do with an argument concerning political philosophy and does not concern me. I am concerned with the issue at large and not the horserace between the two parties. I am not concerned with their consultants, their public relations campaigns, their focus groups, their sound bites, etc. Ideas are of my concern.,well good because we're close to being on the same page because when someone starts bashing conservatives the first thing i think is communist but i just try to be polite and call them democrat.\n\ni would like to point out that this works both ways.

__label__2 , Explain the similarities and differences between salt marsh and mangrove communities?,,The main similaritiy between the two is that they are both located salt water tidal zones. Salt marshes are collections of a variety of marsh grasses and plants, while mangroves are small woody trees/shrubs with tangles of large, extensive root systems. Salt marshes can exist in a variety of temperate areas, but mangroves only exist where water temperatures exceed 75 degree F in the summer. \n\nThe rise and fall of the tides is the important ecological feature that allows the creation and sustainance of these unique habitats. If the grasses/mangroves were constantly submerged, they would suffocate and die. if they never were submerged, they would not receive the constant replenishment of nutrients carried in by the rising water. There are also important chemical processes that are triggered in these tidal zones (usually related to the cycle of conditions where oxygen is available (low tide) and not available (high tide.)\n\nBoth salt marshes and mangrove swamps are important habitats for fish, crabs, shore and wading birds, and other animals. However, the animals that inhabit the two may be different.
__label__3 , How effective is Dialectical Behaviour Therapy?,I am 19 and have recently been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. My psychiatrist has recommended that i undergo Dialectical Behaviour Therapy. How effective is DBT? Has anyone been through it or known anyone who has been through it and come out for the better? I am a little unsure as to what to expect. \n\nThank you,I've been in and out of therapy since I was 6 (I'm now 30) and DBT is the most helpful thing I have ever tried. I am a major advocate for it, I wish it was more widely offered.\nFor me, I always knew something was wrong but didn't know what or why or what to do about it. DBT lays it all out in a way that makes sense. It teaches the skills for being able to make real changes in your life. If you are ready to really face your issues and take a very honest look at yourself, then I highly recommend it. It truly can change your life and significantly reduce suffering. \nThe only negative thing I have heard about it have been due to the individual not liking the way the group was run, which had more to do with the people running it than the content. \n\nI would say, if you can get into DBT, do it. Try it. You have nothing to lose and so much to gain. It is very worth the effort. I wish I had been introduced to it at 18, I think my life would have gone a lot differently if I had.\n\nFor more info try these websites (the first will let you read what other people who have tried it have to say about it, the second will show you what it actually is) :\n\nwww.remedyfind.com\nwww.dbtselfhelp.com\n\nIf you want any more information on bpd or dbt, feel free to email me.

__label__2 , Is there a way to make water weigh less?,,It depends what you mean by weigh less.\n\n* If you are referring to its density, cooling it below 0°C at Standard Temperature and Pressure will freeze it, and reduce its density (boiling it above 100 C again will have the same effect).\n\n* If you are just referreing to the weigh (and not the mass), taking your water to a place with a lower gravitational field than earth's field (eg the moon, or in a space station in orbit) will make it weigh less; since P = m g. Where P is the weigh vector and g is the gravitational field.\n\nBeware: heating it to water vapour (or freezing it to ice) will NOT reduce its weight, just its density.

Getting enough sleep is up to you.  If you are having trouble sleeping which you indicated you are then you need to mention this to your doctor the next time you have to see him or at your annual physical.  You need just as much sleep as you get older.  Trouble with sleeping is something you need to discuss with your doc when you see him.

__label__2 , Can biking on uneven terrain be faster than on flat?,Assume a flat course on which a biker can average 30 kilometers per hour, if putting his maximal effort.\nNow assume the same biker goes on a terrain the same length, half way uphill and half way downhill (ending in the same location where he started).\nCould he obtain a better time on the second course? Like if he is able to maintain an average of 20 km/h uphill the bike would propel him at more than 45 km/h downhill?,According to the conservation of energy, your answer is negative. The effort that biker put in each case is consumed to resist both the friction and the work needed against gravity. On flat path, no vertical work is made so his energy (name it E) is totally consumed for resisting friction (f) against movement of him (M) and his bike (m) along the path (L):\nE=(M+m)*g*f*L\nNow suppose a terrain path (LL) which is surely longer than the straight one (L) which have a max vertical difference of H. The work he must do to move to the top is (M+m)*g*H plus the work needed against alongside friction. The energy will change back to kinetic form during descend session, and therefore cancels the initial effort put. The only work that is to be done is resisting against friction over the longer path, which is certainly more than the straight (shortest) path.

__label__2 , who was peter medawar?,,Sir Peter B. Medawar, OM, FRS (1915--1987). British immunologist of Arab extraction (which, as he said in Memoir of a Thinking Radish, makes him sound like a kind of gum). Won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1960 for work on tissue transplantation which eventually helped make organ transplants possible. In addition, he wrote extensively, and extremely well, on science and philosophy. \n\nPeter Brian Medawar was born on February 28, 1915, in Rio de Janeiro. He is the son of a business man who is a naturalized British subject, born in the Lebanon.\n\nMedawar was educated at Marlborough College, England, where he went in 1928. Leaving this College in 1932, he went to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study zoology under Professor J. Z. Young. After taking his bachelor's degree at Oxford, Medawar worked for a time at Sir Howard Florey's School of Pathology at Oxford and there became interested in research in fields of biology that are related to medicine.\n\nIn 1935 he was appointed Christopher Welch Scholar and Senior Demonstrator at Magdalen College, Oxford, and in 1938 he became, by examination, a Fellow of Magdalen College. In 1942 he was Rolleston Prizeman and in 1944 he became Senior Research Fellow of St John's College, Oxford, and University Demonstrator in zoology and comparative anatomy. In 1946 he was elected a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and in 1947 he was appointed Mason Professor of Zoology at the University of Birmingham. In 1951 he moved to London as Jodrell Professor of Zoology at University College, London. Here he remained until 1962, when he was appointed Director of the National Institute for Medical Research, London.\n\nMedawar's earlier research, done at Oxford, was on tissue culture, the regeneration of peripheral nerves and the mathematical analysis of the changes of shape of organisms that occur during this development. During the early stages of the Second World War he was asked by the Medical Research Council to investigate why it is that skin taken from one human being will not form a permanent graft on the skin of another person, and this work enabled him to establish theorems of transplantation immunity which formed the basis of his further work on this subject. When he moved to Birmingham in 1947 he continued to work on it, in collaboration with R. Billingham, and together they studied there problems of pigmentation and skin grafting in cattle, and the use of skin grafting to distinguish between monozygotic and dizygotic twins in cattle. In this work they took into consideration the work of R. D. Owen and concluded that the phenomenon that they called «actively acquired tolerance» of homografts could be artificially reproduced. For this earlier work on transplantation and growth, Medawar was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, London. When he moved to London in 1951, Medawar continued to work with R. Billingham and L. Brent, on this phenomenon of tolerance, and his detailed analysis of it occupied him for several years. He also carried out other researches into transplantation immunity.\n\nThe Royal Society of London, where he was the Croonian Lecturer in 1958, awarded him the Royal Medal in 1959. In the same year, he was Reith Lecturer for the British Broadcasting Corporation. He has been elected a Foreign Member of the New York Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.\n\nIn 1937 Medawar married Jean Shinglewood Taylor, daughter of a Cambridge physician. They have two sons, Charles and Alexander, and two daughters, Caroline and Louise.\n\nFrom Nobel Lectures, Physiology or Medicine 1942-1962, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1964 \n\nThis autobiography/biography was written at the time of the award and later published in the book series Les Prix Nobel/Nobel Lectures.

__label__5 , What is RFC(request for comments) ? and what is the relation between RFC and MIB(management information base)?,,Hi,\n  RFCs are internet standards developed for the internet community. These standards have to be followed if you are building a software/protocol which has to work along with the internet. MIB or Management Information Base is a component of Network Management suites.

__label__1 , Starting a GSA in my high school...?,I would love to start a Gay-Straight Alliance at my school, but I need a teacher sponsor and I just don't know where I could begin to ask.  Also, I am out to all my friends but none of my family, and do you think this is a worthwhile endeavor considering that I know now is not the time to tell them (gearing up for senior year is stressful enough... I know if not now, when, but I will, I just don't want to rush it)?  Would it even be worth the trouble?,I would check out what they have on the GLSEN website, they have a whole student section with stuff about how to start a GSA\n\nhttp://www.glsen.org/cgi-bin/iowa/student/student/index.html\n\nMight be helpful. \n\nAs for asking teachers, I would try to find the most liberal one you can think of.  I would look for a teacher who is 1) under 35 2) teachers something not math, computers, or science, look at music, psych, social studies, librarians, or sex ed teaches  3) if you cant think of someone, talk to your principal (or vice principal, whomever is in charge of student activities and ask for suggstions 4) and just scew up your courage and ask.  Pitch it as you want to form this club to combat bullying and anti-gay harassment and give support to fellow gay students, as well as build bridges between gay and straight people.  Yes, someone might turn you down.  Yes they might get all uncomfortable and weird and turn you down.  But you know what, thats life kiddo.  People are going to turn you down, people are going to treat you like a freak because you are gay, some people are going to be down right bitchy about it.  But that is exactly why you need a GSA - because it is rough to be gay.  If you cave now, you'll spend the rest of your life feeling like a dumbshit for not just going through with it.  Some rejection from a teacher who you will never see again after graduation is not going to ruin your life.  And you shouldn't be embarassed becuase some people are phobes.  If some teacher turns you down, they are the ones who should be embarassed - and you should make them feel as such.\n\nIf they turn you down, just lay on the old guilt.  Say that you're sorry that they are not more willing to be accepting and supporting of diversity in the student body, and say that you are really disapointed that you will not be getting their support because it is so necessary for teachers to take a stand and lend authority to anti-bullying efforts.  You've got nothing to feel bad about because some people are cowards, freaks, and phobes.
__label__7 , How can I get a job doing office work?,I'm 19 and looking for a part-time summer job. I've done the fast food worker and cashier worker thing before but I always hated it. How can I get hired to do some find of office work? Where do these kind of places advertise that they're hiring?,The best thing is to apply or go through a temp agency. I have office experiance and being hired in at a company I make less then my friend made by going through a temp agency. There are websites online and you could check your local newspaper in the classified job section. A temp agency is the best way to go though since they have lots of contacts and you have potential to make more. My friend that mentioned started out making more then i did and she has no office experience prior, after getting hired in (once the temp time expired) she was given a $2.50 raise. I know that isn't always the norm. of things but since Then i have switched jobs and she still makes more then me. There are local temp agency all over the place. They even have ones that specialize in office workers. Good Luck!

__label__1 , which horoscope personnel are best suite for your business partner?,,It depends on your sign. You need balance in a business partnership.\n\nYou can't have two leos as partners - they will kill eachother fighting for the same portion. Take a look at your sign but more importantly - at your personaility. You want a partner that can balance you.\n\nIf you are the outgoing type, hyperactive, good with people then you need a number cruncher, good at deep thinking, focusing on details. Likewise the other way around. Both of you - as business owners - will always be able to see the large picture as well as the small one.\n\nEvery business has a sales sides and a day-to-day side. They are both important. A good example were the owners of Palm (before they left the company).\n\nJeff Hawkins was the creator, the visionary. Donna Dubinsky helped focus him with her management skills. They each understood eachother's strength and weaknesses. The sum of their parts were greater then the individuals.\n\nSame thing with Apple computers. Two Steves. One was a people person - the salesman, the other a focused engineer. Together - they were the dynamic duo - each feeding on the others strength.
__label__1 , Why are there Christians who are so full of hate?,From some of the posts on this site to those lunatics who picket at funerals holding up signs that say God hates fags, it seems like so many Christians are not following the tenets of their religion.  How about judge not, lest ye be judged and let he who is without sin, cast the first stone and turn the other cheek?  What would Jesus think of his followers if he came back today?,I saw that sign some supposed Christian had too.  I could hardly believe it.  Most Christians totally miss the point about what being a Christian is all about.  \n\nI don't think Jesus ever intended for people to form a religion around himself anyway. He was only trying to point out what was wrong with the Jewish practices at the time.

__label__7 , Can an employer exclude certain employees from it's Group Health Insurance policy?,,Genrally part time employees and contract (1099 paid) employees are excluded from eligibility. the employer can also establish a probationary or waiting period for new employees. This is the length of time the employee would have to work full time before they would become eligible for the health insurance. Typically this period is 90 days, but it can be longer or shorter.
__label__10 , What did you make of the whole Terry Schiavo situation?,I would say that poor, poor woman except that she was for all intents and purposes dead while all that crap was festering around her.,I think the poor woman should have been allowed to die with dignity a long time ago.  I'm quite sure that she would not have liked all the drama attached to her situation as well as those home movies that were all over the news.  It was horrible to see someone made to stay alive like that when she was really not living at all.  If you polled a thousand people I don't think even one would say that they would have preferred to have their life prolonged when there was absolutely nothing to look forward to.  I feel horrible for her husband as well as her parents, but I'm happy for her that now she's in a better more peaceful place.

__label__1 , Do Christians & Muslims worship the same God??,The answer to this question depends on what is meant by same God. There is no denying that the Muslim view of God and the Christian view of God have many similarities. Both view God as absolutely sovereign, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, holy, just, righteous. Both Islam and Christianity believe in one God who is the Creator of everything in the universe. So, yes, in this sense, Christians & Muslims worship the same God.\n\n \n\nAt the same time, there are also important differences between the Christian and Muslim view of God. While Muslims view Allah as possessing the attributes of love, mercy, and grace; Allah does not demonstrate these attributes in the same manner as the Christian God. The most important difference, though, between the Muslim and Christian view of God is the concept of incarnation. Christians believe that God became a human being in the Person of Jesus Christ. Muslims believe this concept to be the ultimate blasphemy. Muslims can never accept the idea that Allah would become a man to die for the sins of the world. A believe in the incarnation of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is absolutely essential to the Christian understanding of God. God became a human being so He could empathize with us, and more importantly, so He could provide salvation, the forgiveness of sins.\n\n \n\nSo, do Christians and Muslims worship the same God? Yes and no. Perhaps a better question would be, Do Christians and Muslims both have a correct understanding of what God is like? To this, the answer is a definitely no. There are several crucial differences between the Christian and Muslim concepts of God. Both faiths cannot be correct. We believe that Christianity has the correct view of God because there can be no salvation unless sin is paid for. Only God could pay such a price. Only by becoming a human being could God die on our behalf, paying the penalty for our sins (Romans 5:8; 2 Corinthians 5:21).,Though muslims & christians have many principles in common, i guess they have many many diffrences, like what u said; muslims don't believe in Jesus Christ, they beleive no way God can become a human being, while chrisitians for example don't believe in Prophet Mohamed, and both beliefs are the core of religions, which means if u don't believe in Jesus Christ u can't be a chirsitan and if u don't believe in Prophet Mohamed u can't be a muslim, even the view of god in both religions are different, so i guess the answer would be no.

__label__3 , do people who work in restaurant kitchens have to be checked for aids?,,No they dont.  Tney do however have very strict codes of food handling and hygiene. (Thats for everyone, not just people with HIV/AIDS.)\n\nIf any worker cuts themselves the full batch of food is thrown away.\n\nPeople with HIV/AIDS are not any kind of risk to anyone in most jobs as the virus cannot be passed on like that.  Obviously the exceptions are in the medical industry, as an accident with a scalpel/sharp could easily cut the practitioner and the patient.\n\nFor most jobs a person wouldnt have to declare they had HIV/AIDS and quite rightly too. Unfortunately there is a still a social stigma attached to people diagnosed as HIV positive. But the truth is these people pose no risk to us in everyday life.  We however pose a great risk to them if we have any form of infectious illness and they are at a stage where their immune systems are suppressed because of the condition.

I would like to get the Pill, but how/what should I ask my doctor? \nThanks,Talk to the doctor, get the pills and take them. \n\nAsk if he would prescribe pills so you won't have your period for longer than the normal 28 days. Standard bc pills make your body think it is pregnant so the menses are suspended. At some point the pills turn into placebos, or they run out and your body goes back to having the period. So, you have to ask the doctor if you can do it. He will give you pills that won't go to placebo or won't run out before your next desired period.

So, I am going to try to give you advice for what I am assuming your age group to be... WITHOUT... trying to seem like the other people by lecturing, or demeaning you.\n\nThere is something that you need to realize... at your age most guys are jerks that are mainly trying to scheme on young ladies like yourself. I think you need to realize this because I don't think you will get the answer you are looking for if you decide to confront him and ask him the truth, because he most likely is going to lie.\n\nI know that you seriously don't believe the this young man slapped the girls booty simply to avoid being slapped... I'm not saying that your friend is lying, maybe she just doesn't know the WHOLE story.\n\nIn the event that, that is the truth and he was doing no wrong maybe you should find out if he is just committed to your relationship as you are, because a week doesn't seem to be enough time for any couple to know if they want to be together or not. In a  week most people are still just getting to know each other.\n\nThe answer is simple. You are young, and there are going to be PLENTY guys for you in your life. So I think you should still be cool with this young man, just don't put so much focus on him and him only :)

__label__2 , What is the brightest star and how far from it would we have to be to get the same light we get from theSun?,Also how far away from this brightest of stars would we have to be to experience the same heat levels? Thanks,The intrinsically brightest star known is S Doradus, a star in one of the Magellanic Clouds.  It is so far away that it can only be seen with a telescope, and in fact probably no longer exists, since its distance of 180,000 light years exceeds its estimated life expectancy of 160,000 years.  However, you would have needed to be 0.11 lightyear from it to have the same insolation as the Earth gets from the Sun.  Of course, a larger percentage from S Dor would be in the form of ultraviolet, enough to kill in a few hours.  Not recommended for tourist visits by the Galactic Chamber of Commerce.

Why not just follow the Old Testiments?Y need to change?,,From what I understand, the teachings of Jesus and his sacrifice supercede and override the old laws of the Old Testament.  The Old Testament was supposed to be a follow up to the true Gospel which arrived when Jesus walked the world and died to save humanity from its sins.  From that point on, following the old law was no longer necessary for salvation - only the accepting of Jesus Christ as the true lord and saviour would lead to redemption.

__label__7 , When explorers came to Ontario in the 1600s what tribe of indians did they find along the St.Lawrence river?,PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,There appears to be a lot of tribes...and it would help if the exact time in the 1600's were given. Apparently the earliest records of the area claim that Ontario was mainly occupied by the Algonquian and Iroquoian nations (indian tribes). However the first European to get there was Jacques Cartier and he made his way up the St. Lawrence river and met what he called the St. Lawrence Iroquoians at Quebec City in 1535. Now obviously I realize that you asked for explorers in the 1600's so the next person would then be Samuel de Champlain who visited the same area in 1603, however the tribes that Jacques saw were gone. According to my research, that area during the late 1500's and throughout most of the 1600's had gone through several different (tribal) wars as well as European vs. tribe wars. The St. Lawrence river then became what is referred to as no man's land until the Iroquois came out victorious in battle. Another European finally visted the same stretch of land that the two previous explorers visited and there, met up with the Iroquois nation. However this was in 1673 and the time might be a little to late for your question. \n\nRegardless my best guess would be the Iroquois nation; seeing as how the St. Lawrence Iroquoians were halfly influenced by the Iroquois nation (the other half being the Huron nation) plus the phrase sounds more like a nickname than anything else. Hope I helped. \nQuestions about the issue: CanDo417@e-garfield.com

It has to be tied to the record, as each will be different.  I know there is a way to create a shortcut to a specific file, but in my case, a way to open the directory that file's in would be great.\n\nThanks in advance!!,Just like the way you would create a shortcut to the file, you can just create a shortcut to the folder itself.

Right click on and you need to copy or keep note of the location. The location will show you the path to the folder. Then go back to your desktop to whichever icon you want to use as your shortcut, right click on it, and then on the location path name, paste the location there.

__label__5 , auto cad/ floor plans?,know what 17 risers @ 7-5/16 means not sure how to make the steps. are they 17? please be specific,a 17 riser would be like stepping up a flight of stairs made out of piano benches.  7-5/16 is a more standard riser height.  I would guess that you need a quantity of 17 risers, each at a height of 7-5/16.  That gives you a floor to floor distance of 10'4, which is a reasonable distance between two floors of a house/residence/etc.  The question to ask your architect or draftsman is how deep are the treads?\n\nMore basically, the riser is the piece of the stair that is vertical, and the tread is the piece of the stair that is horizontal.  Floor-to-floor measurements are often made from finished surface to finished surface of two storeys/stories of a house.  Building codes typically require that continuous runs of stairs all have the same riser height and tread depth, within a tolerance of usually less than 1/2 inch.  without this, we'd all be living in Willy Wonka houses and tripping up and down the stairs all the time.

__label__2 , what was the relationship between Japan and the other western countries before and after World War 2?,,Before WW II \n\n1854 - Japan, formerly a closed country (foreigners not allowed in) is opened when Admiral Matthew Peary sails his fleet into Tokyo Bay. Japan remians sovereign, under rule of the Shogun. The Emperor is largely symbolic.\n\n1854 - 1900 - Japan invites Germany to train the army, Britain to train the navy, and the shogunate disappears as the Meiji Restoration occurs (Emperor Meiji, who brought Japan into the modern industrial age). Japan industrializes, zaibatsu, or business combines ruled by important families, expand, and Japan becomes relatively modern industrially. \n\nGlobally, Japan is looked down upon as an asiatic nation of yellow skinned slant-eyes who could never equal a western nation.\n\n1850 - 1900 - Golden age of colonization - Britain, France, and Germany carve up Africa, and other independent territories. Japan has no colonies, just a few Pacific Islands.\n\n1905 - Russia and Japan go to war over Japanese desire to expand its influence in Asia, particularly Korea and northern China as well as the Sakhalin Islands.\n\nJapan kicks Russia's butt, sinking her far easter fleet and gaining new territory, including the Sakhalin Islands.\n\n1910 - Japan conquers Korea.\n\n1920's and 30's - Japan continues to expand into China, setting up the puppet state of Manchukuo in northern China. The US, which supports China, is concerned, and cuts off supplies of strategic materials to the Japanese. Japan is viewed with suspicion by western nations.\n\n1936 - Rape of Nanking Japanese forces capture the city of Nanking and pillage and rape. Thousands of civilians are raped and killed during a short period. Japan's international reputation falls even more.\n\nlate 1930's and 1940 - America moves to cut Japanese purchase of strategic material totally. No oil or steel goes to Japan from the US. Japan is outraged. Japanese planners beging to plan removing the US as a force in the pacific and expanding Japanese military operations to secure supplies of raw materials (East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere).\n\n1941 - Japan, ruled by the Emperor Hirohito, but run by Prime Minister Tojo, an army general, bombs Pearl Harbour and begins military action in the Pacific.\n\nAugust, 1945 - Japan surrenders after being defeated on land and sea, and being hit by two atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nSeptember, 1945 - General Douglas MacArthur takes over control of Japan. Emperoro Hirohito stays in. This allows the Japanese people to save face and gains the Americans support by all parts of society in Japan. \n\n1945 - 1950's - Japan recovers from the effects of the war. Like the Marshall Plan in Europe, the US helps Japan to rebuild, and works with the Japanese to bring in a democratic constitution and a democratic form of government.\n\n1950 - Korean War begins. Japan is an important staging point for American forces.\n\n1950's - 1970's - Japanese products are sold world wide. Japanese goods are known as shoddy and cheap. Made in Japan is not a sign of quality.\n\n1970's - 1990's - Japan's economy continues to grow, while the US suffers through the economic malaise of the OPEC embargo, Vietnam and Watergate. Japanese quality improves. Toyota, Datsun, Sony, and other Japanese firms become quality global brands through the late 1970's and throughout the 1980's.\n\nJapan is now considered as an American ally and works closely with the US in economic matters, as well as giving civilian support to military endeavours, such as Iraq. Japan's constitution forbids the country from having a standing army or navy, although it does permit a Defense Force to defend the homeland.\n\nJapan is now a key player in the global world, both politically and economically. What a difference from being voluntarily totally cut off up to 1854!

Even if it was you who assaulted him it would be the same outcome. They have cracked down on so much of the domestic situations these days in every state nation wide. To many people end up getting killed and hurt very badly after females (males) drop the case. It's just impossible for you to drop it it's up to the state your in to protect you now. Even if you don't want it to happen. It's evident that he needs help controlling his anger and it doesn't mean your a bad person. Hopefully you understand that could have been the last time he ever hit or abused you. You could have ended up in a pine box. Believe me I understand where you coming from but you need to go to counseling and understand what the outcome of his actions are no matter what you ever do or say. NO PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO PUT THEIR HANDS ON ANOTHER PERSON IN A VIOLENT MANNER.

PLEASE, PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!,I'm very fun to be with and when I'm with my family and friends I'm not shy at all. But when I'm with kids that I don't know as well, I'm sort of quiet. I know that I am, but I don't like it when kids say that I am. When I just minding my own business sometimes, some jerks will say why are you so quiet, and I don't know what to say. Then today, we switched seats in Social Studies, and I overheard this girl say Oh, he's not talkative at all. He doesn't say a word. He's so quiet, and they said that about me, after finding out their new seat. So I have a few questions:\n\n1. How can I be more outgoing?\n\n2. Why does everyone think I'm quiet?\n\n3. Why does everyone say I'm quiet?\n\n4. What should I say when they say why are you so quiet?\n\nThank You So Much!!!!!!\n\nBy the way, I'm a 13 year old boy in 8th grade.,Here is some advice. Get more talkative! don't be afraid to talk to someone! There not going to not talk back! Also never hang out with just one group of people! I ran for my class president and I won because I was open to hanging out with new people! Trust me in the long run it helps! And about people calling you quiet make jokes with them! People call me the silent Gangster! lol But you be who you wanna be and if you don't wanna talk than don't. And make sure your friends understand!
__label__4 , Will Colleges refuse to accept me if I have superb grades but am failing math?,I've always had a 3.7 or higher GPA but now I'm taking Pre-Calc and failing it. I'm scared that colleges will either, see this fact and turn me down because of it, or not see it at all and only look at my GPA which has been falling because of the class, therefore making me inadequate for accpetance in some colleges.,It depends.  Colleges will not just look at your grades and GPA.  There are other factors that they include.  If you go to their website, they should have a brief outline of what they are going to look at (i.e. SAT scores, involvement in & out of school, etc..) Most likely, I believe, it's the essay that counts; it can either make or break you.  Plus, you have to consider that there are a lot of people you are competiting with.  If you haven't sent in the application yet, try and talk to your teacher and both of you guys may come up with a solution about how to improve your grades.
__label__7 , I am interested in purchasing a home.....?,I read that you can assume another persons mortgage loan through a bank. Does anyone know exactly how this works? Is it a good or bad idea to purchase your first home this way?,FHA loans are assumable and many adjustable rate loans are assumable.  The potential problem is that you have to cash out the owner's equity which means you have to pay them the difference between the loan balance and the sales price.  You also are charged an assumption fee, but it is not much, around $250- $500.  The person who told you you assumed the prior owner's payment history is wrong.  The lender puts the loan in your name and your payment history starts there.  When you assume a loan, you have to qualify just as if you were getting a loan.  This is so that the lender can release the prior owner from liability in case you default.  The potential benefit to an assumption would be if you could assume a loan at a low interest rate or assume an adjustable rate loan that you could convert to a fixed rate at a good rate of interest.  There are not as many assumptions these days because interest rates have been so low in the last 10 years that it made more sense for people to get a new loan than to assume one at a higher rate of interest.  In any case, you need to know what you can qualify for.  I have been both a mortgage banker and a mortgage broker and, based upon my experience, I would reccomend you call a mortgage banker to discuss your qualifying options.  Many mortgage brokers are fine loan officers, but you end up paying both the lender's fees and the broker's fees in many cases so it may be more cost effective to consult with a mortgage banker.  In addition, many mortgage banks have special comittments from the largest mortgage securitizers, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHMC) that allow them to offer special loans to first time buyers, those with limited funds availability, or credit challenges.  Good luck and happy hunting.  I hope you find the home of your dreams.

So why don't they become a non-profit corporation, avoid paying taxes, and donate even more to charity?,great question!\n\ni don't know the answer to this question, but I think it has something to do with the fact that they effectively (through Paul Newman) donate all of their after-tax profits to charity, rather than provide charitable services directly. \n\nIn other words, perhaps they are not able to structure themselves as a non-profit and claim non-profit status because they do not provide any direct services.
__label__7 , Is MLM or Network Marketing a feasible business structure?,Would like to know your opinions.. thanks! =),Maybe.  It's feasible if 1) you like HOW they market, 2) you follow their process.  The critical part of any MLM is to get people to do the same thing over and over again.  This usually means there are a lot of rallys and sometimes inauthentic pep talks.  What's happening is people are replacing what large corporations have to pay to accomplish.  So, if I were Nestle, I'd have a very large marketing and advertisiting budget to tell people to buy Nestle Hot Chocolate.  But, if I'm Stevens, I get a bunch of people to tell their friends and family tht this is the best hot chocolate made in the world.  If I were to trade my time to do that, I'd get paid for that.  I'd also get paid for anyone else I've gotten to do that with me.  \n\nSo, it makes sense.  It works, if you work it.  What are the drawbacks?  I've looked into a few, and found that I can't keep my dignity and do these things.  I am a thinking person, and thinking is not allowed with these groups.  They want you to follow the formula, kind of like a drone in a bee hive. \n\nAlso, a lot of these groups don't have a lot of credibility.  Face it, you hang out with a lot of people that are kind of like you.  In an MLM, a lot of people aren't like you.  When you bring people like you to meet with people not like you, they wonder if you're like them.  In a typical business arrangement, Nordstrom shoppers don't mix with thrift store shoppers, and so nobody questions whether the store can meet their needs.  MLMs mix up the people in a way that favors people who believe in the lottery, but don't invest in their own education.  \n\nLast thought: I know a lot of dignified and successful people who have worked in MLMs.  Some of these have incredible wealth, and they did it on the merits of their labor, not on anything else.  It's a way to level the playing field.  \n\nWhatever you decide, good luck

The Vikings will most likely finish 8-8, the Falcons have dug themselves a hole and I think its too deep to get out of, the Eagles arent contenders without McNabb, and the Niners have their three toughest games on the road with 5 games left. \n\nSo I see the Rams, Panthers/Saints, and Giants battling for the NFC wildcards.\n\nWith the way the Giants are playing right now, I dont see them standing much of a chance with their tough schedule left. If they get back to playing Giant football and come out and beat Dallas next week, theyre right back in the mix. If they lose that game, count them out.\n\nThe Rams have been choking, but might have saved their season yesterday vs the Niners. I see them going 4-1 in their final 5 games and clinching a spot in the playoffs at 9-7.\n\nI think Carolina will actually finish 10-6 as well as the Saints and end up winning the tie breaker over the Saints. Giving the Saints the other wild card.\n\nAs for Seattle, Shaun has to get back on the horse and get some yards to help Hassleback get into a groove. If Shaun and Hassleback are banged up like they have been all season, I wouldnt be suprise if they ended up forfeiting the NFC West to St.Louis or San Fran and missing out of the playoffs.
__label__7 , Does anyone care when shopping at sites showing they are safe from hackers.?,I think it's only a marketing ploy.,Sure it is a marketing ploy. It is used to communicate to users that the website they are using is hacker safe, thus instilling trust in customers. The leading reason why some people still don't shop on the web is fear of getting their information hacked and out to criminal elements.\n\nMany websites who use certifications from Hacker Safe, for example has shown increase in conversions. And if you are a retailer, a 2% or 10% increase in conversion is a BIG THING. It's one thing to get traffic, but another to convert that traffic into sale. And if getting hacker-safe certifications would do it, etailers will do it.\n\nThe leading outdoor lifestyle company Woolrich, according to a June 30 press release issued, tested this premise and used ScanAlert’s Hacker Safe certification on the site. ScanAlert is a company that “conducts comprehensive daily security audits of ecommerce infrastructure and then certifies the security of it in real-time by allowing the HACKER SAFE certification mark to appear only when a site`s current status meets the highest published government industry standards.” \n\nThe company used two control groups of shoppers to test the impact of the Hacker Safe certification. During the three-week test displaying the certification, Woolrich shoppers who saw ScanAlert’s HACKER SAFE certification mark while visiting woolrich.com produced significantly more orders compared to the control group. Woolrich attributes the certification to improving their website’s already high conversion rate by 3 percent.

__label__3 , what are the main reasons why people have schizophrenia?,,Man, most of these people are severely misinformed about the causes of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders.  Cats walking in your food?  Non-vegetarian diets?  Give me a freakin' break...!\n\nSchizophrenia may affect the victim who has it in many different ways and on many different levels of severity.  One may be slightly schizophrenic, or schizphrenic to the point of loss of all social functioning and ability, i.e., it can be disabling.  It is characterized chiefly by paranoia, paranoid delusions, and/or hallucinations - either auditory or visual.  ANYTHING that can affect regions of the brain responsible for vision and hearing can then alter those perceptions and yield signs that would be diagnosed as schizoaffective, for example.\n\nPhysical damage directly affecting the brain can lead to behaviors symptomatic of schizophrenia (you fall down in the park and a stick goes through the roof of your mouth into your brain and causes brain damage, or you use drugs so much that it causes chronic physical overuse of seratonin receptors which results in cellular and functional brain damage are 2 examples of things that could happen physically).\n\nThere is believed (some evidence exits) to be a genetic component to being pre-disposed to having schizophrenia, but keep in mind that most people are not born with overt schizophrenic symptoms.  This suggests that it is more of a socially generated disorder, and is caused by gross misintrepretation of one's local and global environmental states coupled with his or her lack of self-esteem and self-confidence.  Someone with a lot of self-confidence will not become paranoid that everyone is talking about them, and are less likely, therefore, to show signs of paranoia, develop delusional thoughts about conspiracy, etc...all symptoms of schizophrenia.  Someone with no self-esteem or self-confidence, on the other hand, will be more likely to think everyone is against them, that secret agencies like the CIA are pitting conspiracy against them, and that others are plotting to hurt them in some way - since these things are not really happening (that is to sayt they are delusions), this individual will be diagnosed as schizophrenic when he tells these things to his psychiatrist.  There is interestingly the commonality among schizophrenic patients that the people that are out to get them are either secret agencies or large, powerful institutions - the CIA, the FBI, the government, the IRS - this is thought to be based on the fact that the victim needs to fulfill his paranoiad delusions somehow, and these organizations are not well known so it would be difficult for someone else to refute the fact that they are or are not after him.  That is, it's hard to prove that the CIA doesn't have a file on you, because if they did they wouldn't tell you.  This is referred to as paranoid security, and is common among all schizoaffective patients.\n\nSo there are a lot of reasons one gets schizophrenia - the only common factor is that the causes are related to changes in brain chemistry, as I mentioned this is either physical or chemical in nature, and can have a variety of root causes.

__label__4 , why did Iocaste give up her child so easily in Oedipus Rex???,why did she not try harder to save her child(ie, maternal instinct)? why did she immediately leave her child to die, instead of trying to stop the oracle in some other way, or see if it even happens? my only guess is that teh greek gods were thought so highly of that she gave up Oedipus becasue of her trust in the gods and to protect the family name... got anything better?? also, where exactly is the reversal of the situation in Oedipus Rex, aka Oedipus the King, aka Oedipus Tyrannus.,Since the founding of religion, the gods have sought to test those with power. Jocasta was sent by Apollo to do just that: to test Oedipus' faith and conviction. \n\nThroughout the play, Jocasta tested the beliefs of those around her by feigning disbelief in the gods herself. Though she put up this false front, she did keep her faith. At the beginning of the scene wherein a messenger relayed word of Polybus' death and Oedipus' ascension to the throne of Corinth, we see Jocasta praying - not the act of a disbeliever at all! Again, in the same Episode, Jocasta carries garlands and incense to the altar and tries to appeal to Apollo to purify the city of Thebes. \n\nWhile her faith remains strong, her task from the gods is to test the faiths of others, especially that of Oedipus, which she does. After accusing Creon of conspiracy and treason, Oedipus relates to Jocasta the details of his meeting with Tiresius. Jocasta proceeds to plant doubts of the gods by telling Oedipus the story of the Delphian Oracle and the circumstances surrounding Laius' death. Again, after Polybus' death, she excitedly tells Oedipus that his prophecy was obviously untrue, though it wasn't, and by doing so she attempts to hint that the oracles - and thus the gods - are false. By planting this doubt in Oedipus' mind, the gods are able to test his faith, and his ruling power, through Jocasta - a test which he fails until it is too late. \n\nWhy, then, would Jocasta be forced to perform such a dubious task for the gods? It is because she tried to avoid an earlier prophecy. By tying her child's feet together and casting him out, she attempted to defeat the gods, and this of course angered them. Her punishment, then, was to test the beliefs of the very child she cast out. \n\nOedipus Rex was Sophocles' attempt to show the Greeks that they could not avoid the dealings of the gods, or they may be forced to conspire against the very people they should love most. Jocasta was, in this way, a victim. Though it was by her own doing that this penalty was cast upon her, it was not something she was happy to do, which becomes apparent when she realizes the truth in her earlier prophecy. It is at this moment that she becomes aware of her punishment, and in desperation kills herself. Oedipus Rex is a true tragedy in the sense that fate and Oedipus' own tragic flaw (his hotheadedness) combine to bring about his downfall. What makes it that much more tragic, however, is that the events were, for the most part, out of Oedipus' control. The chain of events was set in motion by his own mother. He was forced to leave Corinth (thus trying to avoid his own prophecy), afraid he may bring harm to the persons whom he loved the most. Scared and angry at the curse he carried upon his back, who can blame him for being hot tempered? It is Jocasta, his own mother and wife, that brings the story full circle by again cursing him, perpetuating a disbelief in the gods. \n\nJocasta is a victim in Oedipus Rex, but not as much as she is a catalyst for Oedipus' own victimization. She keeps her faith throughout and tries to relieve Oedipus of his. Because of this, readers may in turn pity her and loathe her. But the gods tested the king of Thebes through her - the main goal of the play - and both he and she failed. \n\nShe is purely a victim.  She was sent to do a job and like previous paragraphs. Failed.  Her faith was in the Gods.  If she had more in herself then she would have saved her children.  They relied more on their faith in the Gods then in themselves.  I would think now that if someone did this they would be crazy.  Why give up your flesh and blood for a higher power.  I couldn't, could you?\nI didn't understand your last question in your paragraph. Care to elaberate?

__label__7 , Why do young females get pressured to have children by their boyfriend?,,love is the ability to know the worst about someone and still be able to take bull from them...many boyfriends think that they have reached a stage in life where they can confidently say that they are in love, so they want to to have fruits of that love with the girls that they are in love with. these girls are incidentally young. it's not something bad, just a normal unselfish desire but most often, these boys have no idea what having a kid entails; they just want a little version of themselves that they can love and be a family with, allong with the mothers of their babies. it's cool to be a father!(that's what they think). it might be cool, yeah, but it also is a lot of work!

__label__7 , How was buying a home for you?  How was acquiring a mortgage?  I am going to be purchasing one soon...?,I'm buying a small starter house with my sister.\nMy credit is in the mid 700s and my sister has only had one credit card in her name (paying off monthly).\nWe have about $15k in savings.\nI work part time, she works full time but only $7-8 an hour.\nI'm fairly certain the payment will be less than the $555 rent I am paying now by myself, plus we will be gaining equity.\n\nHow was your experience purchasing a home?\nI have a credit union, will rates be cheaper there?\nWhat and how much fees will be involved?  Inspector?  I will not have a buying broker, but they are selling thru a realtor.  Do I need a lawyer?\n\nPlease let me know the good and bad things you have encountered while buying your home.  Thanks!,The first home is the most challenging...so many questions.  But so much fun!\n\nIf the seller is using a broker, you should as well.  The seller is paying a set percentage to the agent (usually 5%-7%) of the sales price which gets split between the agents.  Your agent should be with a different agency to prevent conflicts of interest (there are never supposed to be conflicts, based on Realtor ethics codes enforced by the National Association of Realtors, but it's always better to be safe).  Your agent won't cost you a dime, and you'll have the benefit of representation.\n\nAn attorney (or title company, depending on your state) conducts the closing in all non-cash closings.  Don't get too anxious about specific attorneys, as long as they are reputable, they should be fine.  You could always pick a seperate one from the seller, but it isn't always necessary.\n\nYour fees will depend greatly on your shopping ability.  I suggest printing a copy of your credit report and carry it with you until you find a bank/mortgage company/credit union you are satisfied with.\nAsk questions like what is the APR you are offering.  The APR takes into account all points (a point is equal to 1% of the loan), fees, junk fees, origination fees, and the interest rate.  **Comparing APRs will allow you to compare apples to apples**  Comparing interest rates alone forces you to compare apples to oranges, bannanas, and even watermelons!\n\n**Check with your newly aquired realty agent, or the lenders that you are shopping with, on the availability of 1st time homebuyer incentives....there are litterally hundreds available that will reduce your down payment, APRs, points required, etc.***\n\nThis should be a lot of fun!  Remember that it is OK to get emotional regarding the house, but wait until you have closed and have the keys in your hand.  Keep emotion out of the shopping and financing portion of the process.\n\nHave a great time in your new home!  Best of luck.
__label__7 , What is Bi-polar?,And what is OCD?,Bipolar disorder, often referred to colloquially as manic depression, is a diagnosis describing low (clinically depressed) and high (manic or hypomanic) mood swings significantly broad enough to interfere with an individual's ability to function on a daily basis. Such mood disorders are thought to affect millions of people.\n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder, specifically, an anxiety disorder. OCD is manifested in a variety of forms, but is most commonly characterized by a subject's obsessive drive to perform a particular task or set of tasks, compulsions commonly termed rituals.\n\nOCD should also not be confused with OCPD, the similarly named but notably different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, which psychiatric guidelines define as a personality characteristic rather than an anxiety disorder.

__label__10 , why fight war?,,For anyone that ascribes to Darwin's origin of the species theory (where there is no God who could call all things seen and unseen into exsitence with the command of his Word), war should not be a problem, because there is no finite moral standard... it is survival of the fittest.  Eat... or be eaten, Kill or be killed.\nFor those who have a life-trusting faith in God, it is sometimes harder to decide, since we are past those times when God tells his people to go and eliminate this group or that so that you may have the land that I have promised you.\nIn current times we need to be loyal to our friends who call for aid.  We may sometimes need to step out and rescue a people from an unbelievably oppressive governmental hardship, particularly when that government gives all the signs that it not only materially supports terrorism but that it will conduct unprovoked war on other peaceful nations.

__label__5 , What does AJAX satnd for?,,What Does AJAX Stand For?\n\nAJAX means 'Asynchronous Javascript and XML'. Adaptive Path came up with the term in this essay: http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php. However, the word is really a bit of a misnomer: AJAX doesn't really rely on XML at all, but rather on a Javascript function that happens to be named XMLHttpRequest.\n\nAll About XMLHttpRequest.\n\nXMLHttpRequest was originally invented and implemented by a Microsoft team who were working on a webmail application, and it's been around for a while now (since 1999, in fact). The reason it has suddenly come to prominence now is that Google used it in three projects, Gmail, Google Suggest and Google Maps, and in each case managed to create a much better user interface than they would have been able to otherwise.\n\nSo what does XMLHttpRequest do? To put it simply, it lets your Javascript go back to the server, fetch some new content, and write it back out onto the page - all without the user having to change pages. This gives a 'smoother' feel to web applications, as they can do things like submit forms without the whole browser window needing to go blank and reload the page. Take a look at maps.google.com now, and notice how you can drag the map around anywhere you want to go without having to reload the page. This would be unthinkable without XMLHttpRequest.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons XMLHttpRequest has become popular now is that browsers other than Internet Explorer have started to support it, mainly due to the fuss over its use in Gmail. The function is, by all accounts, a very simple one in technical terms: it was just a matter of someone having the idea.\n\nGetting Started with AJAX.\n\nThe first thing to do to get started with AJAX, then, is to create an XMLHttpRequest object in your Javascript code. As ever, Internet Explorer has to be difficult, doing this a different way to every other browser out there. That means that you should use this Javascript code:\n\nvar ajax;\nonload = function () {\n   if (window.ActiveXObject) {\n      ajax = new ActiveXObject(Microsoft.XMLHTTP);\n   }\n   else {\n      ajax = new XMLHttpRequest;\n   }\n}\n\nWhat you've done there is declared ajax as a global variable (usable by all functions), and then created a new AJAX object when the page loads, either using ActiveX for Internet Explorer or the XMLHttpRequest function in other browsers.\n\nThe next step is to write two more functions: one to get data from a URL, and one to handle the data that comes back.\n\nfunction getText(url) {\n   ajax.open(GET, url, true);\n   ajax.send(null);\n}\n\najax.onreadystatechange = function () {\n   if (ajax.status == 200) {\n   // do things with retrieved text (in ajax.responseText)\n   }\n}\n\nAll you need to do then is call getText from the relevant part of your code with a URL you want to get text from, and put that text wherever you want it to be in the state change function.\n\nThe most powerful thing about this approach is that the URL you send to the server can contain variables, using the old REST (question marks and equals signs) way of doing things.\n\nThat means that, using the code above, you can easily send a request to ajax.php on your server, and include the current value of, say, an input box for a username on a registration form. The ajax.php script checks whether that username is already in use, and then sends either '1' or '0' as its only output. All you would then need to do is check whether ajax.responseText was 1 or 0, and change the page accordingly, preferably using getElementByID.\n\nShould I Use It?\n\nThe question remains over just how useful this is: it's certainly good for some applications where users would otherwise have to submit data over and over again, but it's not much use for smaller ones. AJAX coding has a tendency to take a lot of time, especially the first time you try it, and this is

But let's be honest, does anyone really believe that their party isn't trying to do things that are illegal or at least immoral to sway the outcome of the election?  If you do, I have beachfront property for sale cheap in Nebraska.  The whole system is corrupt and needs to be taken over by the people who actually give the government the power.  That is us, the citizens.  The governed are the only ones who have the ability to stand up and take back the country.  We are obviously too busy worrying about who is on survivor or if the Knicks won.  Or too busy pointing fingers.  We won't change anything by sitting on our hind quarters.  Get out and vote but don't stop there.  Keep an eye on your leaders, all of them.  When they do somehing wrong, write to them, the papers, anything.  We need to demand that the government does the will of the majority.  That is democracy, not what we are disguising it as today.

__label__9 , mom problems...take the time to read, its important..?,ok i love my mom so much, more than anything in the world and if anything happened to her i dont know what i would do.  i know that she always wants what is best for me but it seems like she is always mad at me. sometimes i dont even do anything and she lectures me. i want to try and get closer to my mom but i cant when it seems like she pushes me out of her life.  both of my parents dont trust me and here lately i dont know what to do.  they put so much stress on me but they think that i dont understand what stress is.  but back to my mom, i dont kno what to do now i seem to get in fights with her everyday and im sick of it. its bad to say but sometimes i am afraid to go around her because i dont want to get yelled at.  here lately when i have been going to bed i cry before i go to sleep because i dont know what to do. sometimes i feel as if she doesnt like me being around her but i really dont know. i hope thet you guys can help me.i love her so much.,sounds like your mom is either going through a lot of stress or she is so hard on you because she doesn't want you to make  the mistakes she might of made.Maybe its not that she doesn't trust you,maybe she doesn't trust other people with you.There are some hateful people in the world,thats bad to say,but true.It could be that your mom is trying so hard to protect you from that part.Don't take it so hard.But the first step to finding out what the problem is,is the source.Ask your mom what is wrong or if there is something that you can do to help.Does she take care of you alone?She may be a little bit bitter at having to do that.Talk to her and help her out around the house as much as possible.
__label__5 , what is customer support?,,Simply put, it is what a company is willing to do to help cultivate the relationship with their customers - the people who buy their products or services.\n\nThis can be demonstrated in a number of ways: toll-free phone numbers, live chat to resolve questions, incentives for referrals.\n\nHere's how one company defines it:\n\nCustomer service and support (CSS) is the part of a company's customer relationship management (CRM) department that interacts with a customer for their immediate benefit, including components such as the contact center, the help desk, and the call management system.\n\nAccording to Lithium Technologies (a CSS product vendor), corporate costs for CSS interactions are expected to reach $100 billion in 2004. To increase customer satisfaction, while minimizing the costs involved, many companies are turning to customer-based service applications such as Web self-service and online communities for customer-to-customer support.

__label__4 , Valediction: Forbidding Mourning?,What is the conceit in this poem?\n\n\nAs virtuous men pass mildly away,\nAnd whisper to their souls to go,\nWhilst some of their sad friends do say,\nThe breath goes now, and some say, No,\n\n\nSo let us melt, and make no noise,\nNo tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;\n'Twere profanation of our joys\nTo tell the laity our love.\n\n\nMoving of the earth brings harms and fears,\nMen reckon what it did and meant;\nBut trepidation of the spheres,\nThough greater far, is innocent.\n\n\nDull sublunary lovers' love\n(Whose soul is sense) cannot admit\nAbsence, because it doth remove\nThose things which elemented it.\n\n\nBut we, by a love so much refined\nThat our selves know not what it is,\nInter-assured of the mind,\nCare less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.\n\n\nOur two souls therefore, which are one,\nThough I must go, endure not yet\nA breach, but an expansion.\nLike gold to airy thinness beat.\n\n\nIf they be two, they are two so\nAs stiff twin compasses are two:\nThy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show\nTo move, but dot,The last three quatrains (of which only part of the first made it into your question) are a good example of a conceit, in which the metaphor of the compass is developed at length.

__label__6 , How do you get spin on a golf shot?,,The above answer is partially correct. I suspect you're looking to get spin on a full wedge shot, or possibly some short wedge shots around the green? \n\nBasically you need to realize that most golfers don't play on courses that are mowed with tight enough fairways to get clean enough contact for as much spin as you see the pro's get on TV....they play on fairways that are like our greens. \n\nYou need to have a clean clubface contact with the ball, NO grass in between the ball and clubface. The club must strike the ball at a decending angle of attack (easier with a wedge). \n\nIt's easier to get spin on knockdown type shots....instead of hitting a full sandwedge from 100 yards try hitting a 3/4 pitching wedge or nine iron, you might have more success in getting some spin if the ball comes in lower.....it'll hop once and then stop....

And now I am stuck with it.\n\nAnd yes, sheila does answer some of the most interesting questions, so I consider myself privileged to be going to the same places.\n\nAnd, is she hot?  I don't know, to be honest.  It's just that I kept seeing her name just about wherever I went at Yahoo Answers. \n\nAnd she seems to be a fun person with a great sense of humour. And I must say that by now every time I see her, I smile.\n\nSo sheila, you should know that when I asked that question about you, it was sort of spontaneous because I couldn't believe I was seeing you so much.

__label__6 , Pitchers:  Soreness at elbow as oppose to shoulder?,Whenever I have thrown too much the soreness begins to build just above my elbow.  This is the same spot I have always been sore whenever I overdue it pitching.  However, whenever my teammates complain of arm soreness they speak of being sore in the shoulder, something I have never felt.\n\nI tend to throw a lot harder than my teammates (mid 80s) but I am wondering if I just have different (or incorrect) mechanics or if this is common to have different pitchers sore in different areas?,If you feel a 'sharp' pain in the elbow area, then you might have a problem....If it's just a dull pain try a new exercise. If you are right handed, lay down on your left side. Place right arm, from shoulder to elbow, down your side. Bend your right elbow at 90 degrees (straight out in front of your body). With palm down, pull up a dumbell (any weight that you can do reps with) til it is straight up, then slowly lower the weight and repeat. Pitchers started using this exercise in the late 1990's. It works part of the elbow and shoulder muscles that other exercises don't get to......Again, if there is a sharp pain, go to a sports therapist.

__label__6 , Is Ronnie Brewer good or bad for the rockets?,his 3-point shooting is not good for the rockets but his defense is really great,Brewer will be a valuable addition wherever he ends up because he has a high court I.Q.  and is more mature and well adjusted than many of the other lottery picks mentioned.  This young man is an exception ...he has excellent athleticism and he is one of the most selfless players I have seen on the court...combining solid shooting, amazing court vision for finding his open teammates, and relentless defensive drive...qualities not always found at the NBA level.  Rumor has it, a lot of the other guards projected to go in the top 8 have been avoiding Ronnie in the individual team workouts: likely good advice from agents who do not want to take the chance of seeing their stock fall from a bad showing against this kid who has consistently shown his ability (and capabilites) against anyone who will show up since the pre-draft camp.  Those who think Brewer's shooting will hold him back in the draft are forgetting some important intangibles....this kid has what every coach and GM want in a newly drafted player; natural athleticism combined with high coachability, and a great attitude.  Whatever he is lacking in technique to become a great NBA contributor, can be developed by a good coach.
__label__3 , How can I get help with my anxiety?,I get shaky, my heart beats very fast and hard, my hands sweat, I can't breath/speak, constantly worry about when I will get nervous again, and I become nauseous. It usually happens when I have to speak/perform in front of people or just by myself. It even happened once when I was meeting a group of new people. I almost always have a sick feeling in my stomach even if I'm not really doing anything that should make me nervous. I've tried snapping rubber bands on my wrist, or digging my nails into my skin to take my mind off of the situation, but nothing really helps. I've also tried talking to my mom about it many times so I could maybe get a doctors appointment, but she doesn't think it's a real problem. How can I get help?,You said that yourself: your moms doesn't THINK it's a real problem. Think, it's just want she thinks. You know your own body and what you are thinking.\n\nTherefore, I think you should get help. And you can talk to a counsellor. And why do you need your mom approval to see a doctor?\n\nPlease don't wait until the issue gets worst, go get help now asap.\n\nTake care ^^!\n\n*****additional*****\nI think you can make doctor appointment, even if you are 15. Try it, you never know if you don't try. \nIf you cannot, talk to your school counsellor about this. I suggest you talk to your school counsellor, no matter if you can or cannot make doctor appointment.

Feel free to answer only one but which ever you know of to be more certain or credible.  I asked a general question but would like a multitude of detailed responses so many of us can get a better take on the true or close to true stories are.  Serious responses only.,i don't really know about any of the other things u asked but i can tell u about angels and demons. Angels are God's messangers and the people that inhabit heaven. like us they have free will also. God created angels when he decided to create heaven. Demons and Hell didn't exist until one of the angels decided to sin. he decided that he wuz better than God and that he wuz more fit to be king than God wuz. i don't know if i explained that rite, but bascially he wuz jealous. then God cast him out of heaven and everyone that decided to go with him. thats when hell wuz created. the angel became Satan and his fellowers became demons.

I am of a temperament that I kind of need (or want) to be in control, not overriding the bosses but acknowledged for what I know.  Plz help me know what is best.,If you sit back like a good little girl and don't make any waves, that is what you are going to be know for.  A good little girl that doesn't make waves.\nIt sounds to me that your supervisor is a little nervous about her position.  She is going to retard the growth and progress of anyone she feels knows more than she.\nYou might start off by making documented suggestions.  Document them so she can't claim they are her ideas.

The only way I can know him more is to go abroad and be a person in his real life.What should I do? Study hard and work there after I gain my degree? I need help.,Well, from what you're able to say here, it really sounds like you need to cool off and focus on getting your degree.  After you've got that, then you can think about meeting him.  Maybe by that time he'll want to come here to visit you.  But don't be looking to move and work over in another country without having met the guy in real life yet.  Slow down and think rationally.

__label__5 , what is the difference between socket 754 and socket 939 motheboards?,,its the amount if pins on the processor, thus a 754 wont fit into a 939 or visa versa.\n754 was the first mainstream amd64 socket. the max cpu that will be made for it is the 3700amd64. it is going to now be the budget line so it wont be developed a whole lot further as for as mainboard features. it does not feature dual channel memory.\nskt939 is the current enduser socket. processor speeds are going beyond dual core 4800+ processors so there is a definate upgrade path. it can handle dual channel memory. the motheboards have features like the nf4 chipset including SLI, pci-express, better sata options, and more. since better chips/chipsets are being manufactured on 939 it is also perferred for overclockers and \nThe major difference between S754 and S939 is that S939 processors have a 128-bit memory controller and the S754 has a 64-bit memory controller. In other words, dual-channel vs. single-channel. That's it, from the processor's standpoint. As for the other candy (SLI, PCI-E, etc), those are generally to be found on S939 motherboards, simply because those are where the manufacturers make their money.

I had A Boyfriend a while back and he was my first love my first EVERYTHING! and now evertime i date anyone else i break up with them right when things start to get serious or im so paranoid that hes gonna cheat on me i run them away...how do i fix my problem,You need to stop dating for awhile.  Just tell guys that you're not dating right now and suggest to just be friends and hang out.\n\nLook at it this way.  If I jab you in the arm with a pencil, it would hurt but it wouldn't be horrible.  But if I jab you in the arm with a pencil into an open wound, then it would hurt 10 times worse.\n\nRight now your emotions are an open wound.  They need time to heal.  As long as guys keep poking your emotions, they will never heal up.  You need to stop dating, and enjoy life on your own while your emotions heal up.  You'll  know when the time is right to get back into the dating thing.  Until then, just say, 'Can we just hang out and be friends?'
__label__4 , How to do this Math question?,Simplify the following without using a calculator:\nlog(2(radical2) - 3log(radical3) - 3 \nall over\nlog9 - log 4 + 4\n\nThe answer should be -3/4, but I just can't get that one.\nDoes anyone know how to work that out?,Okay, let's see if we can get through this.  I'll use R instead of radical just to keep it a bit shorter\n\n[log(2R2) - 3log(R3) - 3] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nStart in the top.  Notice that 2R2 = 2(2^1/2) = 2^3/2 (2 to the 3/2 power).  Likewise, R3 = 3^1/2 (3 to the 1/2 power).  So:\n\n[log(2^3/2) - 3log(3^1/2) - 3] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nNow remember that an exponent within a logarithm moves out to the front.  So:\n\n[(3/2)(log 2) - (3/2)(log 3) - 3] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nNow factor out the 3/2 from each of the terms:\n\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nNow let's go to the denominator.  We'll rewrite the values 9 and 4 as squares, then move the exponents out like we did before.\n\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2)] / [log(3^2) - log(2^2) + 4]\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2)] / [2 log 3 - 2 log 2 + 4]\n\nNow factor 2 out of each term in the denominator.\n\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2)] / [2(log 3 - log 2 + 2)]\n\nOne more little thing to make this work.  We actually need the signs changed in the numerator, so let's factor out a -1 from each term (we should have factored out -3/2 earlier):\n\n[(-3/2)(log 3 - log 2 + 2)] / [2(log 3 - log 2 + 2)]\n\nNow notice that the top and bottom both have (log 3 - log 2 + 2).  Since this appears on both top and bottom, cancel it out.  This leaves us with:\n\n(-3/2) / 2\n-3/4\n\nI know this was long and drawn out--I hope you followed the steps.

Considering the passion and intensity that a scorpio brings to everything, you definitely would have a fiery relationship.\n\nBe careful of mind-games however.  Some scorpios are private and secretive to a fault, while others are blunt and outspoken.  Heaven forbid those two get together and try to change each other.  Doesn't work!

Following an attack on the X-Men by a mutant impersonating Magneto named Xorn (who had previously been a teacher at the institute), Jean and Wolverine were trapped on a space station that was hurtling into the sun. Seeing no hope for survival, and wanting to spare his teammate further suffering, Wolverine seemingly killed Jean, unleashing the Phoenix Consciousness within her and resurrecting her. Returning to Earth, Jean, with the power of the Phoenix, opposed the faux Magneto and was killed by a massive stroke induced by a lethal electromagnetic pulse.

Any suggestions on how I can ease it until I see the doctor tomorrow? Its killing me. Thank u,Sorry to hear you're sick.  Going to the doc is a good idea because they can help you sort a garden variety variety viral insult from strep throat.  I'm sure you've had it done before.  5 seconds and its off to be cultured...\n\nBut in the interim, some of your other advice is good... tylenol, lots of fluids.  If you're getting a lot of nasal congestion its a good idea to deal with that.  The drainage is a continuing source of irritation.  When I was  kid my grandmother made a drink called the Bee's Knees... Its sounds like a flapper girl drink to me now in retrospect.  Its equal parts honey, lemon and whiskey.  Heated.  Stirred.  I found it helpful.  \n\nGood luck!!  Hope you feel better

__label__3 , How can I get rid of a cold sore?,Im mostly looking for stuff I can use at home instead of over the counter stuff, but Im open to suggestions. You think if I did something it would be gone by tuesaday?,A cold sore is a fluid-filled blister which usually appears at the edge of the lips. Cold sores are caused by a herpes simplex virus infection.\n\nWhile anyone can be infected by herpes virus, not everyone will show symptoms.\nThe primary infection can cause symptoms like other viral infections including tiredness, headache, fever, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck.\nBecause oral herpes is so common, it is diagnosed primarily by symptoms. It can be diagnosed and treated by the family doctor, dermatologists (doctors who specialize in skin diseases) and infectious disease specialists. Laboratory tests may be performed to look for the virus.\nTreatment\n\nThere is no cure for herpes virus infections. There are antiviral drugs available that have some effect on lessening the symptoms and decreasing the length of herpes outbreaks.\nAcyclovir (Zovirax) is the drug of choice for herpes infection and can be given intravenously or taken by mouth. It can be applied directly to sores as an ointment, but is not very useful in this form. A liquid form for children is also available. Acyclovir is effective in treating both the primary infection and recurrent outbreaks. When taken by mouth to prevent an outbreak, acyclovir reduces the frequency of herpes outbreaks.\n\nDuring an outbreak of cold sores, salty foods, citrus foods (oranges etc.), and other foods that irritate the sores should be avoided. Wash the sores once or twice a day with warm, soapy water and pat gently to dry. Over-the-counter lip products that contain the chemical phenol (such as Blistex Medicated Lip Ointment) and numbing ointments (Anbesol) help to relieve cold sores. A bandage may be placed over the sores to protect them and prevent spreading the virus to other sites on the lips or face. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) may be taken if necessary to reduce pain and fever.\n\nAlternative treatment\n\nVitamin and mineral supplements and diet may have an effect on the recurrence and duration of cold sores. In general, cold sore sufferers should eat a healthy diet of unprocessed foods such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Alcohol, caffeine, and sugar should be avoided.\n\nFoods rich in arginine that should be avoided are chocolate, peanuts, almonds, and other nuts and seeds.\nVitamin C and bioflavonoids (a substance in fruits that helps the body to absorb and use vitamin C) have been shown to reduce the duration of a cold sore outbreak and reduce the number of sores. The vitamin B complex includes important vitamins that support the nervous system where viruses can hide out.
__label__7 , About how much does it cost to hire a tax preparer?,For a solepreprietor ?,It all depends on the complexity of your return, where you live, and who you have prepare it.  Tax prep services like H&R Block usually have a set fee based on the forms they fill out for you.  A CPA will charge you an hourly rate plus expenses (which are nominal).  A small CPA firm will probably charge you around $75 per hour to prepare your return, a medium sized firm will be around $125, and a large firm can be from $150 to $300 per hour.  My suggestion would be to ask fellow business people in your area if they can recommend a CPA.  No matter the cost, trust and integrity are the most important qualities of a CPA.  If they're good, someone will recommend them.  :) PrissyPanda, CPA

__label__6 , can i hard chrome a stainless gun?,,Bound's hubby here:\n\nEmphatically, NO!\n\nFor two reasons!\n\nFirst, if you go to re-finish a firearm ... what people neglect to do is to machine down all of the surfaces that interact with each other, thereby reducing or destroying the part tolerances. Any finish added to a firearm requires an equal reduction of the firearm's bearing surfaces. You do not just throw on a finish.\n\nSecond ... many metals do not take a finish. Stainless, as used by most frearms manufacturers, is really quite durable. Its reflectiveness will be less than the reflective qualities of hard chrome. \n\nMy recommendation is, if you want a firearm with a hard chrome finish, trade-in your stainless handgun and get what you really want.\n\nGood luck!

However, I am unable to connect to the internet. When I switch to a different network that I am able to pick up, the signal strength is low but i am able to connect to the internet.

It sounds to me like a router issue.
__label__9 , What do you do with being snubbed my other mothers?,For instance their are those 'Parent Council' women at our school whom think they are better than us other mothers.

__label__7 , How is Book Value per Share calculated for a corporation?,How can a company with only $4.25 per share of net tangible assets have a book value of $12.30 ???,The remaining book value can be from intangible assets like goodwill, trademarks, copyrights, organization costs, non-compete agreements & others. Many of which could be worth considerably less than the carring value on the books. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging usually from 5 to 15 years.\n\nHope this helps.
__label__10 , Have you changed your mind about the war in Iraq in the last days or weeks?,,No, because I've been pro all along.\n\nMy mind has changed about a related concern, though: up until recently, I viewed the American Democratic party as an embarrassment and had little concern for them. \n\nNow, after the stunning showing the Iraqi people made in this last election, so soon after the defeatist words of Howard Dean and other Democrats, I truly worry for the future of the Democratic party.\n\nI mean, I may have voted Reuplican in the last election, but I think it would be really, really bad to have only one viable political party in this country.\n\nSo instead of mostly feeling embarrassed for the Democratic party, I am mainly fearful for their future.

__label__8 , Lots of anime fans want to make anime, why?,I mean I like music but it doesn't mean I want to be a musician, I'd be terrible!  I'm practically tone deaf.  And a lot of the fans only care about whether a picture looks like a anime, not whther it's good or not.  And when you try and tell them that there are no schools that teach 'anime' in America and that non Japanese company is going to hire them unless they are supernaturally talented, which of course means they have to learn how to animate first, they get all ticked off.  Yeesh!  I mean, concentrate on getting your owns tyle and imitating the popular styles in America if you want a job here.\nI do not get it at all.  I'm an anime fan too, and I don't want to crush your dreams but some of them are old enough to know better.\n\nThere a few people I know who will suceed that animate in that style and that is because they are talented animators and artists and prove that they can do lots of styles.  They are artists first, and anime fans after.,Good question. Yes they probally want to attempt to make their own anime by just pure inspiration. But why stop them? Let them at least try. And maybe at one point, it'll be just a phase and they just want to give up on it. Maybe theres a chance that they wont be good enough no matter the teachings that have been given to them. And maybe they might succeed. But either way, they are doing it. Even though i find it abit dumb myself. I cant find them dumb for being an anime fan.
__label__1 , I am Pagan, what are Christians so afraid of? Or is it just ignorance that causes this animosity.?,,People tend to fear that which they do not understand, or which challenges their preconcieved notions about their world. This is particularly true for those who are insecure in their avowed beliefs, which are actually nothing more than inherited beliefs from their parents. The unexamined faith is actually no faith at all. It's almost axiomatic that the more insecure people are in their own faith, the more hostile they are to the faiths of others.\n\nThat's why they seem to be afraid of you, and why they seem antagonistic: you call into question beliefs about which they themselves are insecure.

__label__7 , If I win a $10,000 gift certificate or gift card to a store is there anywhere I can sell or exchange it?,The gift card is to a grocery chain.,As long as there is no stipulation that the card is non-transferrable, you can try to sell it on ebay.  My guess is that you won't get anywhere near the cash value of it because it's insanely rare that anyone gets gift certificates for that large an amount especially on groceries. You will then be further limited to hoping to find a buyer among the people who have access to that particular grocery store or chain.\n\nThere are also a few websites where you can sell gift cards or exchange them for gift cards to other stores and although they were discussed in the news for a while, a great number of people still don't know they exist so again, you'd be hoping for a buyer from a small scross section of people.\n\nWith a certificate that large, in my opinion, the only way you can get the best value out of it is to just use it yourself over time until it runs out.

You just have many more people bringing down the average for men than for women.

My husband on the other hand will repeat a mistake until bodily harm has occured, lol.

They made nerd rock for the masses. You can also see this effect on The OC. Seth Cohen is a geek, but he is beloved by kids everywhere.\n\nEmbrace your inner geek.

I believe it was song by a young school girl in Baltimore, but I have no basis for that other than a vague recollection.  \n\nThe lyrics/refrain went something like this:\nYou can keep the toys dear Santa, / cause they're not on my list /\nit isn't very long this year cause i only have one wish. / \nSee, Mom and I are all alone and we're here on our own. /\nSanta can you bring my daddy home?  \n\nI don't think it ever has been produced, which I find surprising.  Maybe this year it will make a comeback.  Thanks for your help.,it very well could have been a local song there in balmer...

__label__5 , CD-R Strange Occurrence?,I Burned a CD-R, (Imation), with 26 songs, (79' 34), and put a label on it.  I played it in the car and It played fine until track 16.  Then it started skipping real bad and continued also on Track 17.   At this point I took it out and tried it in the computer and it played fine until Tr 20 and there it started skipping also.  So I figured it was a bad disk and burned another, and it plays fine anywhere.  Before I threw the original away, just for the heck of it, I removed the label and cleaned the surface with alcohol, (I did a real good job).  Then I tried playing it again and found without the label, it plays fine both on the computer and in the car.\n  \nQuestion: Is it possible there could be a problem with the label or the way it stuck on the disk?  I have used 30 or 40 of these labels and never had a problem before.\nStrange.......Any comments?,Label could have been off center enough to mess up the speed. Since the CDs have a reflective surface, the label couldn't interfere with the laser except through vibration caused by the off-center placement.

If you get caught later on, you'll get fired, and then you'll have to explain an even larger gap in your employment history.  If you're going to make it on the outside, you have to put the felony behind an uninterrupted work-history, so you can't afford to get fired.  Get a short term job, if necessary, and then find a better one.  Be reliable especially at short-term jobs, though, because you really don't want to lose that reference.  Good luck.

__label__6 , One more for the scuba divers! How can I keep from getting reg mouth after diving?,Compressed air is sooo dry that by the time I'm done diving--whether it's one dive or four--I have reg mouth... dry, yucky, I feel constantly thirsty. For example, all I did yesterday was pool dive to work on some skills, yet I still feel like my mouth is all dried up like a prune.\nAny suggestions on how to combat reg mouth? \nThanks! :),There's not a lot you can do about it. Diving dehydrates the body which, in turn, causes that dry, yucky taste after you dive. The only thing I can recommend; chewing gum. Especially sour apple gum. It will cause you to salivate and gets rid of the taste. And drink plenty of water!!!

__label__3 , i am just getting over amonia. what should i do as an follow-up.i feel a bid painfull when breading in.?,,I believe you mean pneumonia. I had  an encounter with walking pneumonia myself 5 years ago and know what you might be experiencing. I am not a DR nor RN and don't know how bad yours was but,can tell you that with my experience it takes time to heal. One of the best advices that I can give you is to follow up with all of your DR's appointments. Make sure you take and complete all medications that you were given and try to get as much rest a possible. I suggest that you keep your environment as dust free as possible for this can cause difficulty with breathing. I am not sure if you have any chronic respiatory diseases such a asthma which I have, this could also cause you to still have trouble inhaling. Your lungs are being over worked if you do have a respiatory illness which can cause a delay in healing due to a suppressed imune system.\nIf you continue to experince difficulty breathing I suggest you inform you DR right away just incase you have developed a secondary infection. \nHope you feel better and get lots of rest!
__label__5 , How to chop people from photos using Adobe Photoshop?,I'd like to use a photo of myself for an internet profile page. The photo I have chosen has 2 other people in, I'd like to chop them out. So far I have tried selecting them and pressing delete, this has taken them out of the picture. However, I am left with white parts of the photo and when I try and load it on my profile page these white bits show up. So I'd like to know how to cut them out but make the part of the photo that shows me into a new photo. So when I load it as my profile photo it will just show the photo of me, no white sections.,It would be best to make them turn into the background and leave your picture the way it is.  Use the stamp tool in Photoshop.  Hold alt down and select an area near the person you want to delete to select an area, then click on their face.  It will turn into what you've selected.  You can align it or use the same area over and over and stamp out the faces you don't want.  Be creative and you can make it look like they were never in the picture in the first place.\n\nI use the stamp tool a lot.  It's incredible once you get the hang of it.

__label__7 , Is there any great paying jobs out there with out a college education?,,It depends on what you consider Great Paying and how hard you are willing to work.  Real Estate pays great.  You don't have to have a college education, but you have to take a pre licensing course and courses thereafter to keep your licensure.  None of them are very long.  In Florida the longest course is a 72 hour course I believe, and that is for a real estate broker.  Realtors have to work to get the sale though.  So while it is good money it doesn't come easy.  I also know that some truck drivers and building contractors who make a good living.  Again it depends on what you consider GREAT PAYING.

__label__9 , how do i no if a guy likes me?,,Probably the best way to know if a guy likes you is to simply ask him, but we all know that can be a challenge. So, here are a few clues to working out if he likes you as much as you like him. \n\nSteps \nExamine his body language. If he likes you, you will see that his body position will lean forward toward you. \nKeep close. Ever get the feeling that somebody is in your personal space - so much so that you want to step back? If he likes you and you like him, neither of you will step back. \nMake eye contact - if he likes you, he'll get it and hold it. Again, this can be uncomfortable if you don't like him or vice versa. You'll know if you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly. \nBe aware of touching - he might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, or not move his leg if it happens to touch yours. This is a very good sign that he likes you. \nKeep an eye out. His pupils will dilate (get bigger) if he likes you - but this is quite hard to pick up on and you might look a bit weird looking that closely into his eyes. \nSee if he keeps going out of his way to 'bump' into you. \nWatch for him showing interest in things you like and do. \nJoke freely. Does he laugh even if you aren't funny? \nCheck for signs of nervousness: nervous laughter, sweaty palms, fidgeting... \nSmile. A big smile in return probably means the feeling is mutual. \nSee if he always end up in the same line or group as you. \n\nTips \nDoes he make an extra effort to be around you in certain situations (dances, school, etc)? That could be a sign. \nHis friends might often ask you how you feel about him. \nChances are, if your stomach does a flip flop when you see him, his may be doing the same. \nSmile, be yourself, and let biology and fate work their charms. \nYou can always ask a friend to ask him - but that can backfire. \nYou can't really MAKE someone like you - but the best way to be noticed is to be true to yourself, feel good about yourself and never do anything you don't want to do to get someone's affection. \nThink about how you act when you like someone and look for those signs in others. \n\nWarnings \nDon't spend too long trying to find out or you may look like a stalker and this will also backfire.

For example, we see a blue-coloured object because the object reflects blue light into our eyes.\n\nA black-coloured object absorbed all lights falling on it and does not reflect any light.  As no light comes into our eyes from the object, it is seen to be black in colour. On this reasoning, you can't produce a black light.

Since spending went up and revenues went down, you have an increasing federal deficit.\n\nThere has been a lot of money spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  There have been tax breaks that have continued for large corporations including the Oil industry.  There have been a huge increase in earmarks which are basically money Congress loots from the budget to give to people in their own districts.\n\nAs a registered Republican since 1979 I am distressed to see my party abandon fiscal responsibility and even more distressed that this burden will now fall onto my children and grandchildren.

__label__4 , How does it work?,What is the process and requirement for getting financial aide?,The first place to start is by filling out the Federal Application for Student Aid.  This form is sent to the school you are attending and you are then considered for institutional aid as well as government aid.  If you indicate your interest on the form, you will be considered for Pell Grants, Federal Work Study, Stafford Student Loans as well as scholarships.  How much money you receive will depend on how much money you make and how old you are.  For instance if you are 19 years old, unemployed but your parents are rich doctors, you will not be offered grants (free money) but you will be offered parent loans (loans mom and dad have to pay back).  22 is the magic age where your parents income is no longer a part of your FAFSA, unless you qualify for one of the special circumstances such as you are a ward of the state (orphan), you were adopted or you are no longer a legal dependent of your parents (not tax dependent, legal dependent). If you are a parent or have dependents that will help your chances of getting grants.  You have to apply for a PIN first, then you can submit your information to the FAFSA folks.  Check out http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/ and your school's financial aid site for more information.  Merit based (GPA, volunteer work, etc) scholarships are awarded by the school and not the government.

__label__6 , who did celtic sign larson fae&did he play England?,,Larsson started his professional career playing for Högaborg at the age of 17. He subsequently played for Helsingborgs IF and Feyenoord. Although he was finalising the details of the contract with Grasshopper-Club Zürich in 1993 he moved to Feyenoord for £295,000. Following a complicated contract dispute with Feyenoord, he was signed by Celtic manager Wim Jansen in July 1997 for a fee of £650,000. His debut against Hibernian at Easter Road was less than spectacular: he inadvertently passed the ball to Hibs player, Chic Charnley, resulting in a 2 - 1 loss for Celtic. He didn't fare much better in his first European game, scoring an own goal, although Celtic did run out 6 - 2 winners.\n\nHe is apparently going to finish his long career at Helsingborg.
__label__9 , Does his carelessness to my cutting means he doesn't care about me?,I have been cutting myself for two years now, but unlike my friends or family, who doesn't approve my cutting and tell e not to do it. My boyfriend doesn't seem to care about it at all. I'm not looking for attenion, I do it to cope with my feelings. But I noticed that he's not like the other boyfriends who doesn't like that their girlfriends cut themselves. I asked him once if he likes it or not that I cut. He told me he doesn't know...One day I was having a bad day and told him that I wanted to kill myself. It didn't seem to be a big deal to him. Am I just acting stupid or does my boyfriend not care about me?,Sometimes people avoid things that they don't know how to deal with. My guess is that your boyfriend is personally shocked by the idea of cutting oneself, that he doesn't really understand it, so he isn't quite sure how he feels about it. Therefore he avoids it. \n\nSome people are so worried about saying the wrong thing that they don't say anything at all. If otherwise your boyfriend is a wonderful person and a supportive boyfriend, I doubt it has anything to do with you. But if he is always disinterested and genuinely shows no concern for you in any aspect, dump that loser and get yourself someone better.\n\nObviously your boyfriend cannot be relied upon as a source of support in terms of SI/suicide. Therefore, you'll have to find someone else. Consider why you told him. Were you looking for support to recover? Psychologists and such can be great resources. Or if you simply want someone to talk to (you personally have to want to stop if you're going to), other friends/close associates can make great listeners. Or call a hotline: 1-800-DONT-CUT. \n\nGood Luck!

__label__7 , What do people look for in a career besides earning potential? Is money usually the main motivation?,,Different things motive different people.  You have to determine what motivates you.  Money, attention, recognition, training, growth potential, etc.  Look for a company that will provide you with what it is you want from life.  Remember that there is no future in any job.  The future lies in the person who holds the job.  Be a person of integrity and always do your best, not for the company but for yourself.  Make sure you can look in the mirror each day and know that you have done your job the very best it can be done.  Most employees don't do this even when someone is standing over them.  You will be successful in most careers if you will persevere, be positive, loyal and a person of integrity.

No-one can help you on this list. We're all just guessing what might be wrong, and in any case we can't prescribe a cream or course of treatment - you have to see a doctor. It's unlikely you will be able to use anything you can just buy in a drug store.\n\nDoctors have seen all kinds of things in their seven years of training, and then every day since then.

Why do some make this wrong?,Why am I looked at s strange for loving my own woman and wanting to build a world with her and our family?,Brother Mustafaa, where have you been all my life?!  Just kidding!  It is so nice to see that there are still some Black men who are attracted to Black women and don't see anything wrong with dating Black women.  You are not strange or racist for wanting to date Black women!  A lot of people on this website throw the word racist around too much and they aren't using it correctly.  Racism is an institutionalized system by which certain groups of people are oppressed; their civil rights are consistently denied.  How does choosing to date and marry someone from your particular ethnic group qualify as a racist act?!  Whose civil rights are you violating?!  I personally think your attitude is a lot healthier than some of these people (usually people of color) who REFUSE to date someone of their own ethnic group. I think deep down people view Black as wrong and ugly;that's why you're viewed as strange for liking Black women.  They don't understand why on earth  you would want to date a Black woman when you can get a prettier white, Hispanic or Asian woman.  I say if it's okay for Caucasian people to fall in love with each other, it should be okay for Blacks to do the same.

Abolition was a result of the war, but it was not the cause.\n2. Lincoln freed slaves, but it was not his primary objective.\n3. The North was not a big civil rights region. They treated immigrants worse than slaves. Slaves are worth something and cost money. The Irish aren't and cost very little.\n4. By the way... Income tax. Anyone hate it? Lincoln instituted it and promised after the war it would be stopped. \n\nLink is the succession ordinances:

__label__10 , how do i marry my fiance now that he is in California State Prison?,He is in the reception center awaiting to do a 2 year sentance.  Can we still marry while he is in there.  Any insight would be greatly appreaciated!!!,You will not be able to marry until after he is mainlined. There are no reception center weddings. After he is mainlined, he can request a marriage packet from the Chaplain or his counselor. For details about the facility after he's mainlined, visit the appropriate forum at http://prisontalk.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=257\n\nOh, By the way, has he sent you a visitor's questionaire yet? It is form CDC-106, he has to sign the back before he sends it, but once you are approved to visit, that approval will follow him to his mainline facility.\nGood luck to you both.

__label__6 , India ranked 117 th in Fifa ranking.Abnormal with very strong economy and 100 crores population?,,Another abnormal thing is India winning nothing in every olympics. This is because India lacks sports culture in general, sports is just not given enough importance. Also add the fact that the whole nation is totally in love with cricket which is faboulously marketed. The Indian FA is just not rich enough for the betterment of the game. One thing i might mention India did get an invitation in 1950 WC in Brazil. But at that time FIFA had introduced the new rule that all players must wear boots. Indian players were not used to it & FA could not afford it also as India had just got her independence in 1947 & was economically unstable. Secondly  we might not be in the WC but we do have world's second largest football stadium in the world Yuva Bharti Krirangan in Kolkata which can sit 150,000 people.
__label__10 , An act of asymmetric warfare waged against us?,Can anyone explain what the commander of Guantanamo even meant by this ridiculous comment? On what planet does this make sense? Conservatives:  please reply....,First off, no, the comment is inane and offensive.\n\nSecond, to dispute other posts - asymmetrical warfare is what we face when we fight suicide bombers. They blow up a bomb and kill 50 people, we can't retaliate by killing 50 of the Jihadists, because we don't know who or where they are. We have to try to track them down one by one. This creates the asymmetry.

__label__2 , How are exponents used in astronomy>?,stellar mass, distance, temprature, and phenomoemon.,astronomy in particular deals with very large numbers, which can be difficult to handle. using exponents(scientific notation) makes that easier.\nfor example the average distance from the earth to the sun is 93,000,000 miles. converting to sci notation makes that number 9.3 x 10(7). The distance to the nearest star is 24 trillion miles. How much fun would it be to multiply those two numbers together? not much as real numbers but in scientific notation it is much easier.

If he has a patrolling type site he would be required to check the doors of each building throughout the night to insure they are secure as well as finding a B & E. He could be assigned to a car lot and then his job would be mainly to make sure no cars are stolen. He could be assigned to a construction site and his main duties would be to make sure no constructon equipment as well as building materials are not stolen. His duties may or should vary by job site.

__label__2 , What is bartters syndrome?,,Bartter's syndrome involves a group of symptoms and signs:\n\n    * Enlargement of certain kidney cells\n    * Alkalosis associated with reduced potassium (hypokalemic alkalosis)\n    * Increased production of the hormone aldosterone (see the aldosterone test)\n\nThere is no elevation of blood pressure with Bartter's syndrome, which usually occurs with kidney disease.  Batters syndrome is also known as Potassium wasting.  \n\nThe exact cause of Bartter's syndrome is not known. In some cases, it may be genetic and the condition is present from before birth (congenital).\n\nThe condition is thought to be caused by a defect in the kidney's ability to reabsorb potassium. As a result, an excessive amount of potassium is excreted from the body.
__label__3 , Reappearing of whitish tissue even after removing white tissue EPITHELIUAL DYSPLASIA SEVERE  REASONS     E?,Doctor oral pathologist and dental surgeon took biopsy and found in one section Epithelial Dysplasia severe comment---Though there is no evidence of frank invasion in the submitted tissuses it is suggested that the entire lesion be excised and examined to rule out malignancy. \nAccordingly he did surgery and almost the entire lesion removed fron the lower gum and sent for biopsy. to check the surrounding tissus are normal and not dysplastic. It may take 3 days.\nThe doctor says after the tissues are healed  which may take 3 weeks put another denture. Till then not to use any denture.\nNow whether this dysplastic will further spread  and create problems and how to prevent it. Doctor already removed the entire lesion and did surgery.He says not to worry What is you opinion and precautions to be taken at this stage.,I am not happy that he removed almost the entire lesion, since this was supposed to be an excisional biopsy, but I was not there and do not know the conditions that exist in your mouth.  Perhaps it was very close to the mental foramen and he did not want to leave you permamnently numb if it is not necessary.\n\nThis dysplasia is very likely in response to a poor fitting denture.  It's not unlike the callous you have on your elbow.  Just let the surgical site heal for a few weeks (as recommended) and then either get a new denture or have your existing denture relined (if it is otherwise suitable) so that it fits properly.\n\nAt this stage, just don't wear your denture until it heals and be careful not to bump into the area with any food if you are chewing soft foods.

__label__2 , Do you think we will ever travel in Lightspeed??,Traveling in lightspeed possible?\n\nYes/No??\nWhy??,Probably not.\n\nAt the moment the laws of physics show the speed of light is an absolute barrier for matter. It is not like the speed of sound which was an engineering hurtle, crossing or attain the speed of light is impossible for anything with mass.\n\nIn a particle accelerators the electrons, protons and whatnot can be moved to speeds very close to that of light (like 99%), but they never reach the speed of light.\n\nIf you're in a rocket and turn up the motor you can get closer and closer to the speed of light...but never reach it.\n\nCertainly in the future we will have a better understanding of physics, but it is exceedingly unlikely that something as fundamental as the speed of light barrier will be shown to be wrong. (Just as when Einstein came out with General Relativity - which is essentially a theory of gravity - it did not show that Newton's Theory of Gravity was wrong so much as it only applied to (relatively) small masses.)\n\nAs for the galaxy, those above are correct that it is not expanding. Rotating, but not expanding.\n\nThe universe itself is expanding, and finding over the last few years have found that the rate of expansion is accelerating. Meaning that that in the future the universe will expand faster. Eventually something bad will happen if that acceleration keeps going. But that's in 100 billion years or so, so I wouldn't worry.

Or be one to someone else!
__label__4 , hOW MANY HOURS SHOULD A 1ST GRADE HOMESCHOOLER SPEND DOING SCHOOLWORK?,,here is the answer from homeschool.com\n\nA: The short answer to this, as kids today are likely to say is, 24-7. Again, think in terms of being free from the way government schools go about educating children. If you like schedules, stick with theirs. But realize that an evening trip to the grocery store, a weekend visit to the nature center, and even bedtime story hour are times available for learning together.\n\nSome families sit down and do all their academic (book) work for a couple of hours each morning, freeing up the children's afternoons for personal pursuits. Others scatter book work throughout the day, or note that their children might sit down with a math book for 2 weeks straight, then not touch it again for a month. Sometimes families simply go through the course of a day and only take advantage of teachable moments as they arise.\n\nAs you begin to homeschool, and if you just observe what takes place in the course of a week or so, you'll begin to notice a rhythm - your family's personal rhythm. Here's where you'll get your best clues as to the best times for particular pursuits. Just one word of warning: When I did this, I saw that two of my children were night owls! Just about the time my mind and body were winding down, they were just getting into gear! This was definitely an impetus to help them become independent learners very quickly!\n\n\nhere is my answer:  spend about 2 focused hours learning between breakfast and lunch, and let them follow thier own pursuits in the afternoon.\n\nthe answer for your child;  try out different things.. the answer for your kid may be different than mine.

Her son is not playing little league this year; however, she is showing up at the ball park frequently (now with her fiance of 2 months). I have maintained myself at the ball park but I really want to speak my peace and get it out of my system.   Any ideas......?,The best advice I can give you is: Let it go!

Most types of arthritis are least active in the morning and you feel more pain as the day goes on.  If you have morning stiffness you probably have true rheumatoid arthritis.  It is very important to see a doctor for this because it is not treated like other kinds of usual arthritis.  The special medicines for Rheumatoid arthritis can save your joints from serious damage.  Thanks for asking this question.  Good luck!

There was a giant pink bunny (no kidding!) chasing me around the perimeter of the gym. In front of me was a guy that looked like Indiana Jones, with a whip and everything! We just kept running around the gym. The bunny never caught me and it wasn't scary, it was just weird! Crazy, right?,I had a dream I saw Jesus in Jerusalem when I was a very little girl.  I lived in the mid-west, but in the dream we were in Jerusalem.  I thought I saw something, so I left my mother and went into an alley.  The alley was really dark, and every so often there were people who were playing out Jesus's life.  When I got to the end, he was there.  He held out his hand, and I woke up.\nI only had this dream once, but boy do I remember it!

I hate it for you.  Heck, most of us were teased as kids.  Sooner or later, it is time to grow up.  You know, get a life.\nYou don't like Christians.  Yeah, you've made that fairly obvious.  After the last half hour or so, my guess is that most of the Christians who have been exposed to you aren't too crazy about you, either.  But then, they aren't attacking you, are they? \nThere is no law that says you have to talk to Christians.  The worst they can do is to pray for you.\nSorry about the weenie thing.  Maybe you ought to keep it in your pants.  Then, nobody will know, and nobody will tease you.  Just a thought.\nThanks for the two points, man!  And....have a nice day.  Jesus loves you!!

You probably don't have to do schoolwork on the weekend. but your starting salary will probably be $30K / year.\n\nPharmacy\nVery Difficult, You will not party and you will not sleep eight hours at night. You will spend ALOT of time in the library. You will take classes in the summer. You will play Ping-Pong with the Engineers. (The engineers will probably win because they take dynamics and stuff..) You will have to do homework on the weekends. \nOh yeah and you will probably start at $90K/ year.\n\n\nI say go with pharmacy (if you can cut it).\nBtw. I am a Civil Engineering major and us engineers look down on business majors. I think it is a lot more impressive to have a degree in Engineering or Pharmacy and just take a couple of classes in business, because that is all you really need.

Because the vast majority of words are learned from context, it helps to pay close attention to how words are used.\n\nMake up associations and connections. It also helps to relate new words to words you already know.\n\nCrossword puzzles and scrabble can also help. The best way to increase verbal intelligence and develop word skills is practice.

All evidence shows he visited Rome, but he did not stay there, for one thing.  Another... and this is a big one.... how is it that Priests are not allowed to marry, yet Peter, this supposed first pope, was indeed married?????????  Seems to me it's contradictory in that alone and knocks out most other evidence the Church supplies to show he was Pope.  That and the fact that the term Pope was a Pagan title during that time... and usually meant Father... as in a wise man who guided others on spiritual matters... though NEVER claimed to be infallible.  Merely a helper.\n\nA little bit of study into this will show anyone these things.  And it's all historical evidence outside of what the Church states as historical.  I have a hard time believing that any church or any other particular group has the Truth while everything else in the world shows something different.  Not everyone is out to lie when they write about history.

How about their homeland's rulers, how will they feel when they get not only you back, but a bill and fines for services rendered.  Deportation costs, and fines for any other criminal acrivity that you committed beyond crossing our borders.\nAmerica will show it has a back bone against other invading nations.

PMS is linked to changes in the endocrine system, which produces hormones that control the menstrual cycle.

The one direct cause that is known to affect some women is genetic: Many women with PMS have a close family member with a history of PMS.

__label__10 , Was the World Trade Center brought down by the jets alone or the jets and  pre-located explosive charges?,,The fire combined with major structural damage caused the collapse.  The fire was obviously initiated by the jet fuel, but was further sustained by combustible objects in the building.\n\nWhile it is not frequently discussed, the Twin Towers were rare in that their outer walls were structural (load-bearing).  Typically, buildings have widely spaced columns.  This type of design was heavily dependent of on the steel floor truss systems to distribute the load.  As the fire weakened (important note - not melted) the floor trusses, the vertical members gave way to excessive loading caused by a failure to distribute the loads.\n\nThe excessive weight above the points of weakening caused a rapid, catastrophic failure - observed as pancaking of the floors below the initial point of failure.  \n\nIt has been argued that because the building fell at free-fall speeds, which is largely accurate, it could not have possibly been failure of members due to vertical loading.  However, consider the sheer weight and momentum applied to each floor as the one above it fails.  These are extreme values that no building could withstand.

He let American think he made this song his own and the Judges commended him for being himself  What are your thoughts and opinions?,I never heard it said that it was Chris' own arrangement of the song.  I don't think that Chris tried to pass it off as his own arrangement because just the week before he gave proper credit to the Red Hot Chili Peppers for doing a similar version of Higher Ground. The judges just said that he knows what songs are right for his voice. There has been speculation as to whether Chris mentioned Live's version in the pre-performance monologue and that it was edited out.  I think it is getting completely blown out of proportion and I hope it doesn't hurt Chris' chances.  He is one of the best performers in the competition in my opinion.

__label__2 , How do i draw an MO energy level diagram for HCCCN?,,basic MO diagrams only look at one bond at a time, and usually only diatomics.\n\nyou'll have to draw one for the CN triple bond, one for the CC single bond and one for the CC triple bond.  it is unlikely that you'll have to do the CH bond, though it can be represented in MO too.\n\npage 24 on this PDF (www.upei.ca/~chem342/Resources/ Reviews/Molecular_Orbital_Tutorial.pdf)  shows a MO diagram of CN(-).  this will be similar to your case, except one set of lone pairs on the C will be used in the CC single bond...\n\nthis is an odd quesion because normally polyatomics are represented using hybridization...

Instead it raises the turbine wings and rises in a vertical manner from where it was parked, when aloft the wings will readjust to an angle and thus the aircraft will be flown in a forward motion. It is usually used by the military for operations in areas withour adequate landing space.
__label__1 , Interesting responses to Merry Christmas question?,Funny how some people responded to my question, Will Americans have to move to Canada to say, Merry Christmas?  As a child, we sang traditional Christmas carols in school, and those children who were particularly religious, prayed before eating their lunch.  We all respected it even if we didn't do it ourselves.  \n\nChristmas is a national holiday.  Why is it that some well-meaning liberals think it's their duty to sterilize it and turn it into a secular holiday.  I say, hate us if you want to, but leave us alone.  No one is forcing you to sing Away in a Manger. OK?\n\nOne person narrowmindedly assumed I didn't recognize other religions or that I was shoving a religion down someone's throat.  That's funny because, Christmas is not celebrated by Mormons yet they aren't crying about it.  It's not celebrated by Jewish people yet they respect our right to celebrate it.  My athiest friends respect our tradition too.  \nLiberals, please get a clue.,I so agree with you! There is no reason to take tradition out of holidays and the classroom. As a child I loved the Christmas parties we had before Christmas vacation. Now we can't call it Christmas vacation its winter break, and most classrooms aren't even allowed to have a Christmas tree in them. We can still have a winter party as long as it doesn't have any traditional Christmas images, this includes Santa (because if he doesn't represent all races it is also politically incorrect) For reasons like these, I stopped teaching and am homeschooling my children, they are being robbed of some very fun activities because of a few people that just don't get it.\nWhat cracks me up is we can't pray in school even if we want to but then there are others fighting to be allowed to pray to their Gods because their religion requires pray at certain times of the day.\nWe have tried so hard to make everyone else feel welcome and happy that we have forgotten about the whole premise on which this country was founded on, the freedom of religion.\n\nHappy Holidays and have a GREAT day!\n\nPS... For all those saying Christmas is a pagan holiday... yes and no, all of our holidays have traditions from other religions from around the world not just paganism. And, technically since being celebrated in the states it has been considered by most a Christian holiday (regardless of the original origins) for the Christians that say it wasn't even Jesus’ real b-day, you are right, but it is the day that was chosen to observe it, considering the calendar had been changed so many times we really have no idea when it was.

I had braces for a little over a year before but didn't wear a retainer and therefore three of my teeth are very crooked and misaligned now (the rest are ok). I want to do something about this now to get the problem fixed. I REALLY don't want metal braces, they're just incredibley embarassing. Will invisalign work for serious cases? I don't care about the duration, just as long as it works. Let me know.,I had a very minimal problem with my teeth when I got invisalign...The dentist told me I was a good candidate for it & we started the treatment & I paid $5000...\n\n6 months later I was told I was done, told to use my last tray as a retainer (which was gross after liek 3 months) \n\nWhen I had my Invisalign off, by the end of the day, my gaps returned. Now a year later, my teeth are just as they were before I started, I would not reccomend Invisalign to anyone!

They socially are at the bottom along with poor blacks. They can hate Mexicans all day long for all i care. Mexicans are much superior in many ways. \nHarder working. better fam values, NOT into crime like crazy.\nPr and domcans have been in NYC for generations and still at the bottom. Africans who speak no English come here and work \nand raise themselves and their families up right. I dont get why Pr's and Dr's hate black people? The majority of their blood is black?? I think they are jealous of Mexicans..i dont know. They hate everyone. They are not friendly people for the most part.\nIi dont worry about them. Mexicans make up the majority of span speakers in this country. And are taking power full positions in the gov. i.e. Alberto Gonzales Attorney General of USA.  Pr's and Dr's have done what Washington post writer Stanley Crouch wrote what poor blacks have done. Intertwined their culture with street culture. And have institutionalized their stupidity, for the next generation. If your are a Mexican ins Nyc.. stay workin hard, let PRs and Doms laugh at you....Cuz their kids will be working for your kids someday.

__label__3 , blood transfusions-how long does it take to notice a change in how you are feeling?,,I have had 1 after an episode where I lost a large amount of blood...it only took me about 3 days to feel normal again.  My mother had cancer and received 2, and she felt better within 24 hours.  It depends on the reason you are having one. She was going through chemo and became anemic.  She was very weak and dizzy, kept trying to pass out and could barely stand on her own feet, let alone walk. So it was amazing to see the difference by the next day when she was able to walk without feeling weak and dizzy.  I hope this helps.

You would derive no more energy than you put in.

(3 are major and big while 3 are minor but not so easy)\nI have started studying but its taking a lot time to cover even a single topic. this is because i first read the topic from one book (the one i like)and then from the other book (the one other students study) and then i make my own essay note out of it so that i need not see my textbooks before exams and only the notes.\nwhat  i am asking is opinion is it worth to make such comprehensive notes or should i just read the text and highlight it and wait till the exam night to read it again? the second method wil definitely take less time but i won't have notes at the end?\nwhat do u think.,I believe the time consuming way is the better option.\n  Highlighting would be okay if you looked it over every day rather than waiting until the end of the semester at exam time.\n  I learned to study by taking notes during the reading or lectures.  Rewriting them clearly the same day.  Then each day look them over from start to what gets added each class.  It doesn't take long to scan over them daily and when it's time for the test you don't have to stress or even do anything more.  It has already gotten into your head a little each day and having the structure of your notes repeated,  your ability to recall specific facts will return in that same order.\n  It worked great for me.

On June 1, 2005 he buys back 700 shares of Microsoft stock for $15,000. Discuss and explain the tax ramifications to James on his 2005 federal Income Tax return. \n\n\n\n2) Assume he also purchased 100 shares of IBM on May 13, 2005 for $8,000 and sold it for $14,000 on October 12, 2005. How does this  transaction combine with the first transaction? \n\n\n\n3) If instead of the second transaction James sold his 700 shares of Microsoft on October 12, 2005 for $15,500. How does this combine with the first transaction?,Wow, didn't know people posted homework questions on here.\n\nI'll be nice and help.\n\n1st transaction their is no tax effect for the 700, but the 300 shares have a $900 short term loss.  The other 700 falls under the wash sale rule of the IRS, and his basis remains the same as the original transaction (IE, 700 shares has a purchase basis of $19,600 (700*$28 original price per stock)\n\n2nd Short term capital gain of $6,000.  No releveance to the first transaction since the stocks are from different entitied.  He offsets the loss to the gain for a net gain of $5,100\n\n3rd.  Basis due to wash shale is $19,600.  He captures the loss of the difference (19,600-15,500) leading to a loss of 4,100.  Combine this with the other short term loss of $900, you have a total loss of $5,000.  Of this, only $3,000 short term capital losses may be claimed, and the other $2,000 is carrier over to the next year.

__label__10 , How long must I stay married to a US citizen to get my green card?,Will I have just the green card and/or I'll become a US citizen as well?,You can apply for a green card as soon as you're legally married to a US citizen.  It can take anywhere from a couple months to a couple years to get approved depending on your location and the circumstances.\n\nOnce you get your green card you're a conditional permanent resident but not a US citizen.  You have to apply two years later for non-conditional permanent residency.  At any point during this process you can be revoked if you're no longer married.  You generally are not subject to revocation if you are the victim of spousal abuse.\n\nUS citizenship is separate and you can generally apply after seven years of legal residency.

__label__9 , Do you believe in love at first sight?,,Only in fiction, TV, and Hollywood. You love a car at 1st sight. A dog at 1st sight. Maybe even a house. But with people it is lust at 1st sight then maybe some love grows out of it. Usually once the hot fire of lust cools the relationship goes South, because there is nothing to anchor it on. If it were love at 1st sight 95% of the people would marry and stay married to those they were dating. That don't happen. Reality sets in and you find out someone is too clingy, too sloppy, too jealous, too lazy, hot headed, has too much baggage etc. If it were love you would look pass ALL of that and want them as Forest Gump wanted Jenny no matter how much they screwed up or rejected you. You would wait forever and endure all for real love. Does that happen? Love at 1st sight only exist in Hollywood, TV, and in the movies.

__label__2 , Can a jet plane fly out of earth's orbit?,Since space starts about 100 km...,Out of orbit?  Not a chance.  (Remember that the moon, some thousands of miles away, is in earth's orbit.  So I'll assume that you mean out of the atmosphere.)\n\nThe thermosphere surrounding the earth is very hot. Imagine that a jet could go fast enough to break out of the atmosphere (Mach 5 or so would do it I think)- at this speed even the scattered particles of the thermosphere would generate enough heat to destroy all but the most resilient of vehicles.\n\nThe reason this incredible speed is needed is that once the jetplane leaves the dense atmosphere of earth it can no longer run its engines; they are out of air.  The jet could no longer generate forward movement, or lift, and would lose altitude.  Essentially for a jet to breach the atmosphere then it would have to fire itself into space like a bullet, requiring high speeds, which would likely result in its destruction in the thermosphere.

But I'll tell you this is subjective.  My 17 Samsung monitor has a refresh rate of 35ms and I have never noticed any ghosting with games such as Half Life 2 or Doom 3.  Some people are more sensitive to it than others so if you aren't sure look at the monitor in a store before you buy.

Especially stuff with Clay Aiken, Tom Jones, guys from LOTR, and plenty of other guys.  Even pretty obscure stuff.  Thanks.,I agree with you- it's fun to read the fiction, but imagining the real guys going at it is even better!  Unfortunately, I don't know of any sites that specialize in that solely.  What I've found has been on fiction slash sites, little gems like that, sadly.  Keep searching, though!  Or even better- write your own!\n\nA few I've found and liked- on the site squidge.org, I found a great story about Ryan Stiles and Colin Mochrie having an intimate secret moment on Whose Line Is It Anyways?, and on colbertnation.com, there's a fantastic, funny (albeit short) tale of Stephen Colbert oil wrestling and heating things up with, of all people, Bill O'Reilly.

__label__4 , Boston University Admission?,I know that only admission counselors can legitimately decide whom they admit, but I was wondering what you think my chances are for freshman admission to Boston Unviersity?\n\nI graduated at sixteen and I'm currently taking classes at a community college, as a non-degree special student.\n\nGPA 3.6 W / UW 3.5\n\nSAT I\n690 Verbal\n660 Math\n610 Writing\n\nSAT II\nI will not receive the scores until December, though I think I did reasonably well.\n\nVarsity Soccer captain\nVarsity Volleyball\nVarsity Basketball (nominated all-conference)\nNHS \nPresident of Keystone\nYouth of the Year\n1st Place National History Day Mediterranean District (2005 and 2006)\nLittle League Soccer Coach\nBantam League Soccer Coach\nAvid tutor\nAward of Merit\nHonor Roll\n\nAdvanced Classes:\nAP History\nAP Literature\nHonors Literature\nHonors World History\nHonors English\n(I took all the advanced classes my school offered)\n\nI received all A's and B's in high school except one F in French freshman year.,With your college courses as a nondegree student at the community college, it would make you eligible to apply as a transfer student. It does have its advantages though because of the number of applicants is different than applying as a freshman.  It would also mean you would have to send your community college transcript, so you could get credit for the credits you have taken already towards your degree. I have included some links that could help you better understand the application and admission process. If you have further questions, talk to the transfer advisor at your community college or an admissions counselor at Boston College.

Cross the border poor and broke, take a bus, to visit customs...what a joke!.  Nice man treat me good in there, say I need to see IRS man, get SS# for benefits, then I go to welfare woman.  She say you no need to come down here no more, we send cash to door. Welfare checks, they make me wealthy. Medicare, it keeps you healthy. By and by, I got plenty money. Thanks to American working dummy. Write to friends in Motherland, tell them to come as fast as you can. They come in bus and chevy trucks, I buy big house with welfare bucks. They all come, we live together. Some say they no like the weather. Fourteen families all move in, neighbors patience growing thin. Finally white guy moves away, I buy his house and then I say, find more aliens, house I rent, in the garden I put a tent. Send for family, they just trash, but they all draw more welfare cash.

__label__1 , Why not let gay people get married?,,there is not reason to not let them . the idea of not letting gays get married is sole based in really old people who cannot understand that everyone has rights and that the right to get married is included not matter who u are or which are your preferences .\n\nabout the bible i think it is respectable if a religion refuses to marry gays but the government is not part of any religious group so it shouldn't give preferences to anyone whether they are heterosexual or homosexuals . who u get married to only matters to the person who is getting married and it has nothing to do whit anybody else included the religious groups and the government .

I mean how would you know if he feels the same way? Maybe he is beating himself up over the fact that yall agreed to be friends and he doesn't know how you would react when he says he wants more? Who knows? Try suggesting it indirectly see how he reacts....that way you will know what you are up against.\n\nGood luck!

But the difference here is that you are smarter and stronger. I wont tell you to run away. I think its best to avoid provoking those people to hit on you or anything. As for your parents, just be polite say hi , goodbye.If they act stupidly , its their problem. See the positive side of the situation, they give you shelter and food besides other things. Why should you give your sisters the pleasure of seeing you run away?. Dont give up without a fight. Teach those bitches a lesson. You are smarter and stronger dont forget.

Most Asians think that the ancestors who made it possible for us to be here are deserving of respect and regular acknowledgment; that's why they practice what westerners call ancestor-worship.  Since they have that, they don't need god.\n\nSo there you go.

GSP is a different fighter and a better one now. He was scared and intimidated when he first fought Hughes and wouldn't even look him in the face when McCarthy was talking to them. Now he is stronger has the best stamina and all around better than Matt Hughes. Hughes is a good fighter but he got lucky with that arm bar against him, and he is wrestler and that's all. he is not a stand up person. GSP can knock him out. Hughes doesn't have knock out power. I think GSP will win in the second round.

A 6 volt battery and a filament or model rocket igniter.(you can get these at the hobby store or make your own out of wire.....My daughter and I built a series of light bulbs for a 7th grade science project ) If you run a wire from the battery and glue it on the timer at an appropriate location...then glue(attach) the other wire to the knowb so that when the timer is wound up the wire moves toward the other and completes the circuit in the appropriate amount of time.  Connect a piece if thin wire as a gate to hold the ball and when the timer runs out the battery energizes the wire causing it to melt...the ball rolls down the ramp.  Have fun.....

__label__9 , So, I'm bored, and i want you opinion on this please?,Well, i was wondering what is you opnion on there not being a father in childrens lifes? I mean i grew up without hardly no contact with my dad {im 15} and so far im fine.. I think some pepole can with with it and some hate it.. Also, i poster a question a few days ago, and my friend wanted a baby, and hes only 16.. well he said that he wants a baby so that he can give a baby something he never had {a father} and his mom died like 4 or 5 years ago.. do you think that teen boys that have no father feel alot of pain and suffering because they have no father in there life?,I think a lot of teens feel pain due to lack of a father.  I think a lot of them don't even know what is missing.  But a father is very important.  \nI know one boy who had a lot of trouble and was in Juvenal Hall and drug rehab.  He was telling me one time about the weird thing the therapists were saying in group therapy.  They were saying that a lot of the boys' problems were related to their fathers.  He said to me, How can my father have anything to do with my problems, when I hardly ever see him?  His mother also thought this was a weird idea.  I said that it was the fact that his father wasn't involved in his life, but spent most of his time drunk instead, that the therapists thought was harming the son.  Not to mention the abusive stepfather.  The boy and his mom just couldn't see that this was a problem.\nI agree that some kids handle the situation better than others, and so do some mothers.\nMy own daughter was raised without a father, and I think this had a negative effect on her despite the best I could do for her.  I think she was always looking for male affection, and would do anything for a guy.  Anything.  I feel so sad that she feels there is only one way to get a man's love.  By the way, she did pretty well until she was fifteen also.  \nBut like you said, everybody's different.  \nThe sister of the boy I mentioned, same mother and father, had her problems but determined to have a better life.  She's in the Navy now and has a nice boyfriend.  She's a very responsible person.

Get out and spend time with someone who has a positive outlook on life.  (Preferably a positive female role model) Take stock of what it is you really want in life and who you truly are.  \n\nTake some self-improvement classes.  Go to the gym and work out.  You will meet some inspiring people as you go along.  At the rate you are going, you are only placing yourself in a depressed state and that is so unhealthy.  Lot's of luck to you.
__label__4 , Can you help me with my hypothesis?,Research question I hope to answer: Do sunlight and water affect the decomposition rates of an orange? \n\nThe concern i have is that i need to say what the manipulated variables are and the responding variables and the hypothesis.\n \nI believe it is: \n\n1.Manipulated variable 1: Access to sunlight \n2.Manipulated variable 2: The addition of water\n3.Responding Variable: Decomposition Rate\n\nMy hypothesis is \n\nHypothesis: The orange will decompose best in a condition combining both sunlight and water. \n\nWould this really be two seperate hypothesis? Or can i keep my hypothesis as it is and include two seperate manipulated variables? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks :o),You may leave it as it is in the initial state, however you may wish to note the varied amounts of water. I would suggest that instead of direct water by volume, you try running your hypothesis on the basis of moisture exposure, in conjunction with sunlight, accelerating the decomposition process. More directly, the rate in which decomposition is accelerated by the introduction of both variables. Due to the introduction if varying forms and rates of decomposition, you may wish to include the parasites that become present during the breakdown stages.\n    Also, while your hypothesis is that an orange will decompose BEST in a condition combining both sunlight and water, you must allow for atmospheric conditions such as air, and temperature. But the AMOUNT of water / moisture will have a direct effect on your results.\n                  Good luck!!

__label__2 , Which binoculars for night:  35mm or 50mm and why ?,,If you are in a dark place, I'd suggest 50mm. They collect more starlight and are able to bring out some more of the dimmer stars. The other main question is which magnification to use. Both 7x and 10x are pretty standard for astronomy, although the 10x are harder to keep steady if you are only holding them by hand (rather than using a mount). If you are in a city, 35mm may give as good as you can get simply because the light from the city will wash out anything interesting. :(\n\nAlso, check for multicoating on all the surfaces. This will dramatically increase the amount of light that gets through and is very worth it! (I have 7x50 and 10x70 myself)

These two gasses are minor byproducts of the combustion of fossil fuels due to impurities in the fuel.  When these gasses dissolve in rain water, the rain becomes acetic and can damage things on the ground.\n\nReducing air pollution is a major step in preventing acid rain.

He is only 25. \nHow he can improve his health? or         any other advice related to this?,It is normal for a man to feel weak after sex because men go through a refractory period after ejaculation and orgasm, which means, he cannot climax again during that time period until refractory time is up... For a female, this period does not occur, which allows for multiple orgasms that are very hard to count at climax, but amazing. LoL. You're at the prime time for sex. It's not really avoidable...having sex so frequently won't improve it.

The reason ATP is the main energy source is because that's what happened through the process of evolution. And, as you know, there is no way to determine WHY something happened when it comes to evolution -- despite what the intelligent design advocates will tell you. All you can say, based on the ubiquitious nature of ATP's usage as the main energy carrier throughout most living organisms, is that ATP became the preferred energy carrier very early on in evolutionary time. Probably going back as far as the last universal common ancestor (LUCA).

Each inch difference between the chest measurement and the breast measurement is a cup size.  For example, if the first number is 34 and the second is 36, then you are a size 34B, if it's 34 and 37 you are a 34C, etc.  If the measurements are 34 and 34, you are a boy!!

He is 37, and he's correct.  A man just can't last as long as he get's older... and the sexual drive isn't there like it used to be.  You on the other hand are just coming down out of your sexual peak and are still wanting it ALL THE TIME.

The man clearly knows how to run a football team (even if that hasn't been clear this year) and is entitiled to continue coaching because of what he has done and can contiue to bring to the franchise.  He's better than anyone that would replace him anyways.  Why would anyone, especially someone as classy and loyal as Rooney, fire someone so accomplished just because of one unfortunate year?

__label__7 , Is there a Nigerian Bank Scam warning going on?,I've been contacted by a Nigerian Bank Manager who claims that I have inherited money from a dead relative I haven't heard from in awhile.  They want to put money into my account and are contacting me persistently. They even called me.  They want me to proceed with the arrangement.  I think that this must be some kind of scam.  I can not find out any info from relatives about my nephew dieing a few years back over in Nigeria.  I think that if I were stupid enough to follow through they would then ask for personal info.  I know that this would not be the right thing to do.  I could contact my lawyer.  I think something should be done legally about scam artists if this is what they are doing.,SCAM SCAM SCAM\n\nthis is an OLD scam, they will then ask you for money to open a bank account or for taxes or for the bank manager to travel to your place to give you the cash...\n\nSCAM SCAM SCAM\n\nIF you want to turn the tables on them and SCAM THEM BACK go to \nwww.thescambaiter.com\nand learn how.

__label__9 , cna some one tell me???,a really godd juicy sex story,I am an inch or so under 6 feet tall, and at 180 pounds am in reasonably goodshape. Even though my ancestry is all northern european, I have dark browneyes and dark brown, almost black, hair. I like to think I am reasonably goodlooking, but don't consider myself exceptional.\n\nMy wife, though, is something else. She is quite small, 4'11 and 96 pounds.Her chinese ancestry is apparent at first glance. She has jet-black eyes, andher long, silky, black hair hangs to her waist. She has a slender, goldenskinned body, with almost no body hair, except for the soft, straight hair thatcovers her pussy. She sometimes complains about her breasts, wishing that theywere bigger, but I find them lovely. She has one feature, however, thatstunned me the first time I undressed her - she has the biggest nipples I haveever seen on a woman, even in a movie. She actually has rather small areolae,perhaps an inch across, but rising out of them are two huge, red-brownnipples, even in repose as big as the first joint of my thumb. They are solong that when she wears a bra she actually has to fold them over, and shenever dares leave the house wearing just a tee shirt - they are visiblethrough anything less than a loose sweatshirt.\n\n...\n\nIt was a Friday evening. We didn't plan to go out that evening, so my wife andI got ready for bed soon after dinner. She showered while I went through myevening exercise routine; when she came back out, I headed in to cool off.\n\nWhen I came back from my shower, I found her lying in bed. As I walked up,she threw back the covers. Instead of the nightgown she had been wearing, hersole adornment was a jade bracelet. By the moistness of her pussy, I could seethat she had been warming herself up for my return.\n\nI paused for a moment, running my eyes from one end of her body to the other.Now that she had an audience, she began to run her hands over her body, gentlytugging her nipples with one hand while the other slid down to rub her wetpussy. I wanted to stop and enjoy the view, but I couldn't resist her when shebegged me to come to bed and not make her wait.\n\nAs I walked towards her, I let my bathrobe slide to the floor. She stood tomeet me. As soon as she was within reach I swept her into a passionate kiss.I could feel her stiff nipples rubbing my chest, while she straddled one thighand began to grind her slick pussy against it. She came almost immediately,crushing herself against me as hard as she could.\n\nAfter she had recovered slightly, I laid her gently on the bed. When I laid down beside her, though, she shook her head and made me roll onto my back. Amoment later, she surprised me again by taking my aching cock into her mouth.\n\nOral sex has never been a big part of our love life. Although I *love* the taste of her sweet pussy, she is so sensitive that anything more than a smallamount of kissing sends her into overload. Anyway, she is so responsive thatit is rarely necessary - she almost always climaxes for the first time longbefore I do.\n\nUsually, she is a bit uneasy about giving head, but this night she was suckingaway like a pro. Somehow, I managed to keep myself under control, but it wasa near thing. Just before I reached the point of no return, she eased off,sliding up my body to give me a deep kiss.\n\nAs my breathing began to slow back to normal, she slid out of bed and put atape into the VCR. She had chosen it carefully - it opened immediately intoa scene showing a tiny asian woman mounting a large blond man. Matching hermotions to the tape, my wife moved to mount me. After wriggling a bit to findthe best position, she impaled herself on my cock all the way to the hilt.Before I had fully absorbed the sensation of entry she was mashing her clitinto my pubic bone.\n\nAt first, we both watched the tape. I was soon too absorbed in her to payattention, especially since her long black hair had fallen around my facelike a silky tent. All I could see was her lovely face. She, however,

Socs think they are better then anyone in the world they think they can get anything or anyone. Greasers just be themselfs they dont go around jumping people for the fun of it like the Socs. The only reasons they are really bad is to live. They steal because they cant afford those things. Socs steal because its fun even thought they have enought money.

__label__8 , What was the most memorable Thanksgiving?,,When I was younger at my Grandma and PaPa's house. They lived about 7 hours away from us. My Grandma would spend all day cooking and baking everything from scratch. My Aunt and Uncle would be there. We would sneak in the kitchen and we would try to get some of the crispy skin off the turkey and my Grandma would come rushing over hitting us in the rear end with her wooden spoon trying to get us out of the kitchen. It was always like a game we would play. She would fill up that small wooden table full of food. When they finally got too old to stay by themselves they finally came to live with us. It was never the same after that. I lost my Grandma 4 1/2 yrs ago and lost my Mom 1 year ago. Now Thankgiving has been a bit hard on me. I am trying to start traditions on my own. I will always have fond memories of my Grandma in her little red checkered apron, cooking over her old fashioned stove, and the air filling up with the most delicious smells in the world. My Grandma put the Spice of Love in everything she cooked and no one will ever cook as well as she did.

An immigration inspector at the port of entry determines the visa holder's eligibility for admission into the United States and their length of stay.\nPASSPORT which must be valid for at least six months beyond your intended stay in the United States (e.g. if you plan to go to the United States for 1 month in March, your passport must be valid at least through October). \nFORM DS-156 - All applicants must have a fully completed electronic visa application form with a clear barcode.

Sex is not just a game, and it is not just a physical thing, there is so much more depth to sex. Sex is 90 percent emotion, 10 percent physical driven. Once you have found the one who you love and cherish, and want to spend the rest of your life with.. you will feel more mind blowing physical reactions. Sex isn't about the feeling, it's about pleasing your partner, and them saying thank you, by pleasing you back. Making love, is making music with your body. Not just two people all up ons.

__label__10 , My son joined the National guard. He is 18.   Does this mean he is considered to be emancipated?,We live in Indiana.  He plans to attend IVY Tech in the Fall.  Indiana Law states that emancipation occurs when you become a member of the armed services.  Indiana National Guard is a branch of the Army National Guard,  it is not a state militia.  So I am wondering if this means he will be automatically emancipated and my child support obligations will cease.,He's an adult at 18 regardless of military status.  Your child support obligations ended the day he turned 18.  If you have a contractual obligation to pay for college or otherwise support him past the age of 18, his enlisting in the military will not nulify the obligations, but you should no longer be paying standard child support to his other parent.

Think of St Peter. Think of the omnipresent medieval church and think of hitting your thumb with a hammer. You can't swear, else the local priests will have you up before the Bishop and the Lord alone knows what the outcome of that will be, so you exclaim, in appropriate tone of voice, For Saint Peter's sake and carry on erecting the shelves. This phrase was amended to For Pete's Sake in later, less religiously oppressive, times.\n\n: This is called a minced oath, a substitution of a less offensive word.

__label__3 , if you work out six days a week and stay on a liquid diet,is it possible to lose 20lbs in two weeks?,,ok. i know you're hoping everyone tells you that yes it can work. But don't let anyone fool you, this is not possible. Now i dont know how much weight you need to lose, but the more excess weight you carry the faster it is to lose. I'll tell you my opinion based on what i know and people i work with everyday. Doing that, which is totally unhealthy, i think you could lose up to 5 pounds in the first week if your body has enough weight to lose(meaning if you are significantly overweight you can drop 5), and the second week you could lose about 4. But the minute you are off this liquid diet most of the weight will come back. So i think you could lose up to 10 pounds at the most but that it will just come back. \nYou will probably try doing it no matter what answer you get from myself or anyone else. It is unhealthy as you know and this kind of diet will make you very irritable and extremely hungry. A good alternative to try if you really need to diet and fast is to incorporate slim fast into 1 meal a day. it is a good way to control your calorie intake. And if you are going to follow through with this liquid diet maybe you could try and do it on 3 to 4 slim fast drinks daily. That way you will get some essential nutrients while still consuming far less calories than usual. Some people will disagree with that advice but the truth is that you are going to try some method of crash dieting wether i tell you this or not.\ngood luck

When you log in from different computer, Yahoo! will disconnect the session from your first computer... then once you've connected, your first computer attempts to re-connect to Yahoo which will cause you to disconnect. \n\nTo solve this problem, simply Log Out/Log Off from your Yahoo when you've finished using a computer.\n\nAnother possible cause is someone KNOWS your Yahoo!

__label__1 , How is asking what God does with his left hand perverted?,The Bible talks about his right hand all the time but never talks about his left hand.  I just wanted to know what it does.,You and I both know the answer to this. It's not perverted. \n\nIt's that you're questioning them about their god in a way they've never been questioned about before, nor have questioned themselves. It's like when I ask them if they thought God watched porn!\n\nThe reactions you're getting are because you're getting them to THINK (and I imagine that hurts them, like sunlight does a vampire).

__label__6 , Once the NFL pro-bowl is played in Honolulu next year, where will it be moved to?,I've heard they are going to change venues, which is too bad, because I live in Honolulu, and I always get to meet the players.,In 2004, the State of Hawaii had signed an agreement with the NFL to keep the Pro Bowl in Hawaii until 2009 (at least). The NFL will control concessions, parking, souviners, and advertising at Aloha Stadium for the game. The game being in Hawaii is a win-win situation for the State of Hawaii and the NFL. Coming to Hawaii is an incentive for the players to make the all-star team, unlike the years before the game was moved to Aloha Stadium in Honolulu. Where would you rather play football in February, Hawaii or Wisconsin?

I think a more better option would be in states like Maharastra or Gujrat. If you take my suggestion, I think the area around Vishakapatnam would be great. It is close to Orissa where you can find the steel. The people of Vizag are industrious and the govt is eager to promote industry which is great advantage. If you are looking for a safe option, then Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu is the spot to put up yoour company for obvious reasons.\n\nIn my book, bihar or WB are much better options when compared to your mentioned states.

__label__2 , What is the technical/medical name of croup?,Hint-It is one word that consist of 3 words!  Good Luck!!,Croup: laryngotracheobronchitis, viral croup, spasmodic croup, laryngismus stridulus\n\nCauses:\n\n    * Parainfluenza virus type I, which can be recovered in 60% of cases, causes most cases of croup.\n\n    * Parainfluenza types II, III, and IV; influenza A and B; adenovirus; respiratory syncytial virus; herpes simplex virus; measles; rhinovirus; coxsackievirus A and B; echovirus all can cause mild sporadic croup.\n\n    * Influenza A has been implicated in children with severe respiratory compromise.\n\n    * In 1 case, Mycoplasma pneumoniae has been recovered.\n\n    * Bacterial superinfection or bacterial tracheitis is uncommon. Staphylococcus aureus (most common), Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis cause bacterial superinfection or bacterial tracheitis. Group A streptococcus, viridans streptococci, gram-negative enteric bacteria, and anaerobes also have been implicated. When S aureus invades the trachea, it causes mucosal ulceration and necrosis, and the trachea is covered with a thick purulent exudate. This increases luminal narrowing and exacerbates the respiratory compromise.
__label__10 , Bush says U.S. won't pull out of Iraq How do feel about that?,President Bush, under pressure to change direction in Iraq, said Tuesday he will not be persuaded by any calls to withdraw American troops before the country is stabilized. There's one thing I'm not going to do, I'm not going to pull our troops off the battlefield before the mission is complete, he said in a speech setting the stage for high-stakes meetings with the Iraqi prime minister later this week. \n\n\nDo you ever think there will ever be stability over in Iraq? Do you think our troops will ever come home alive? How many years do you think this is going to continue?,I don't know if we should have gone over there to begin with, but either way we can't pull out now. In two weeks the Iraqi government would be overthrown and the country would serve as a safe haven for terrorist. And one thing I try to keep in mind is that the CIA does not tell us everything, and God knows there may have been other reasons for this mess than we realize. I look forward to the next decade and seeing some of this stuff come into the public view.

__label__7 , what the best way to treat with people around?,,If you mean treat as in pay for dinner or something - as opposed to giving your kid or dog a treat :) - this is the best way I've ever seen:\n\nCourtesy of a friend of mine, I have learned that the easiest way to treat for dinner & not get an arguement of discussion (in most cases) is to inform the server at the beginning of the meal, when ordering. It can be done quietly & with no fanfare - my friend tends to make as if asking a question about the menu & telling the waitstaff at that time - or you can simply precede your order with, And I'll be paying tonight. Another approach is to inform the waitstaff who shows you to your table or to excuse yourself for the restroom & tell the server while you are away. In most of these situations it is an easy thing to do even if other people are around.\n\nAnother thing my friend does is that he will normally jump in to order first when he's decided that he's treating us. It can be quite funny to watch he & my husband if they've both decided to treat on the same night. One server brought the house down one evening when, as they were beginning to discuss the pay issue, she said; Why don't you just split the bill & be done with it?

Besides, us guys are tired of you girls flirting eith us.

__label__9 , Parents Vs Girl Friend?,I love a girl of different religion\nMy parents oppose our marriage due to \n1.Fear of social boycott of our family (including my parents) by society & relatives.\n2.Mental block ness about the other religion girl in the family\nI tried to convince them a lot with by all means but failed.\nMental stress & fear about if I married that girl with out the consent of my parents took toll on my mom’s health.\nCome to learn that together my G F & I do not have any future, as I can’t leave my parents because there is no one to look after them at this stage of life.\nAfter considering the things we decided to discontinue our relationship.\nHowever we are in very much love at this time also.\nWe are still going through the pain of parting….\nEven now also she is very supporting & loving\nHowever some times she feels that I have done injustice to her.\n& She does not know whether she will end loving or hating me for rest of her life\n\nKindly Advice,It's really your decision, but consider the following:\n\n1. Do not let your parents manipulate you by telling you that by being yourself and being happy, you are making them ill. Be considerate, of course, but they have to deal with their own feelings and mature in life still at their age.\n\n2. Introspect, and make sure that you are not doing this just to be a little rebel. Perhaps your parents have such a tight leash on you that you feel that you have to do something drastic in order to assert your independence as an adult. If this is a large part of your case, you would marry for the wrong reason, and very well have problems down the road.\n\n3. Are you sure that the fact that you are told not to marry her does not make you more interested in her than you would otherwise be? Introspect.\n\n4. If you not marry her, how do you honestly think that you would feel about that decision many years from now? Do you think that you would deeply regret it, or do you think that you would have warm feelings for her but be nonetheless more or less happy with another sweet girl? Be honest with yourself; you are best able to make a good and honest decision.

I'm actually a reporting student!  :D  I'm specifically going into captioning, but I've taken NUMEROUS court reporting classes.  The paycheck when you graduate is SOOOO nice (from what I hear).  And the job is NOT boring.  Or at least I have no reason to think so!  And the beauty of it not being a highly recognized career is that when you DO get a job, you'll have LOTS of openings and opportunities to work wherever you want!  You'll never be turned down because the company or court doesn't need any more reporters.  Know what I mean?  So yeah, I think it's and awesome career and if it's what YOU want to do then GO FOR IT!  :D\nMontana
__label__10 , Do college libs. have enough money?,to support their pregnant (married) girl friends?,Most college liberals have enough education to use birth control and varying methods of contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancies. The question should be rephrased towards conservatives, who despite their rhetoric of chastity, are just as promiscuous as anyone else, and are probably very ignorant of birth control and contraception, given that their churches have inculcated them with propaganda stating that these things are ineffective and immoral.
__label__3 , Is there anyway to increase the size of penis witout using suppliments..?,,Dear Buddy,\n\n   Suppliments and gadgets are all a huge scam. I don't care if it's endorsed by the pope himself, it's a ploy to get your money. The only way to increase penis size is through an operation. This operation is about $4,000 and will give you an extra 1in-2 1/2 in. So if you have the money go for it,but I think you should just focus on other aspects of pleasing your partner. A larger or longer penis won't lead to happiness, more dates, or a happier life. You'll just have a funny lookin longer penis. There are tons of ways to please your partner besides beating (him/her) down with your man stick.LOL So good luck and relax dude:)
__label__6 , what to do for fantasy football?,i am playing against a very good team this week and one position i am lacking in is my QBs. I have Donovan McNabb (but has a bye week so has to be benched), Rex Grossman, and Brad Johnson. Some of the QBs that are on the FA list are:\nDamon Huard,\nDrew Bledsoe,\nAndrew Walter,\nSeneca Wallace,\nTrent Green,\nJoey Harrington\n\nI would like to have a QB that is going to be good this week and have a good rest of the season? also, whoever i pick up, i am going to replace with Brad Johnson so if i should keep Brad let me know.,Damon Huard - Probably your best bet.  I actually just picked him up in my league.  Playing really well as of late.\n\nDrew Bledsoe - Riding the bench right now.  Tony Romo took his job.\n\nAndrew Walter - Ummm....No.  You would probably get more points if you didn't play anyone.\n\nSeneca Wallace - Might not be a bad pick either.  Has better weapons than Huard, and more mobility.  And, Alexander is going to be out for another week, so they might end up throwing more.\n\nTrent Green - Concussion.  Going to be out at least one more week.\n\nJoey Harrington - Stay away from.  Has decent weapons in Miami, but no O-line to speak off.\n\nJohnson wouldn't be bad to stay with.  He doesn't put up great numbers, but he is solid.  Go with either Huard or Wallace.  Wallace has better receivers, but Huard will be able to work the play-action pass better with LJ in the backfield.
__label__10 , Why is that ppl who aren't retired the SS doesn't recover?,What i really mean is how is that social security only payes elders who are retired, n some that arent retired, but are elderly?? Why does social security only supports retired elders with monetary awards n not those other elders who haven't made it to retiring, like my dad??? that really pisses me off, what's the reasoning behind it, i think that's discriminatory towards elders who arent retired n arent working??,Social Security doesn't cover the retired because America doesn't have the funds to keep it going.  We are in a very high deficit right now and are deeper in it since the last Bush was out. We were seeing light at the end of the tunnel when Clinton was in office, but George W. is making that a farther and further reality with this war on terror.  We need to create new companies to provide competition here and abroad to generate revenue to pay off our debts.\n\nHope this helps.

__label__3 , Has any one suffered with cysts in there breasts?,i have 2 small cysts, but the hospital wont remove them, im going back for a 2nd visit to the consultant next week.,If you had imaging studies (specifically ultrasound), and the cysts are truely simple cysts and had none of the nine malignant characteristics, that sounds right. We make cysts in all kinds of parts of our bodies (liver, kidney, breast, ovaries to name a few). Cysts are simply fluid filled sacs. They are not cancerous in almost ALL cases. The only time a doctor will remove a cyst is if it is causing you pain or if it doesn't look like a classical cyst on imaging. Cysts come and go. If you remove a cyst, you more than likely will grow more. Aspirating a cyst with a needle is an alternative, but in 50% of the time, the cyst will return. If you are not having pain, generally we leave cysts alone. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. \n\nI am unsure of the specifics of the woman, with breast cancer, who answered ahead of me.  I can tell you that simple breast cysts do not become cancer.  Someone who has breast cysts can develop breast cancer, but that is unrelated to the cysts.  Anyone can get breast cancer, and having breast cysts does not raise your risks.\n\nHere is some things from the experts:\n\nBenign breast disease is a large group of non-cancerous conditions of the breast that includes cysts, fibroadenomas, and hyperplasia. Of all the types of benign breast disease, only hyperplasia is related to breast cancer.\n\nhttp://www.yourdiseaserisk.harvard.edu/hccpquiz.pl?func=show&quiz=breast&page=risk_list\n\nVirtually all breast cysts identified as “simple cysts” by ultrasound are benign and remain so. It is estimated that perhaps 1 in 1,000 cysts may harbor a tumor (not necessarily malignant). These can usually be identified by their ultrasound appearance.

If you really are worried i would just go to the doctor to be on the safe side and to put your mind at ease.

__label__3 , Is being dramatic/impulsive a learned behavior or just part of a persons character?,My bf thank for God for him, point it out to me that I was both dramatic/impulsive. I honestly didn't know but hes helping me to think more before I speak and to not get to excited or overwhelmed when something happens. Are these extremely bad behaviors? Can they be corrected are will they just be apart of my character?,First Dramatic and Impulsive are 2 totally different things. Being dramatic to a situation usually means you are wanting attention, good or bad by taking the situation to the extreme.  Impulsive is to react without thinking, that can be to yell and get angry over nothing or to blow your entire paycheck on a pair of shoes when rents due.  To answer your question they are part of character, and can be altered.  But any behavior you don't like can be changed.  Just like your boyfriend pointed out, you can think before you react, that goes a long way.  You should do that even if you don't think your a drama queen and/or impulsive.\n\nMore importantly you are not making these changes because HE wants you to.  You have to make the change for yourself.  Otherwise it really doesn't do any good.  You'll revert back to your old ways once he's no longer with you.  If this is something you've found to be a problem then make the change, fact is no one like a drama queen only in small doses, and there are good and bad sides to being impulsive.  I'd like to see you keep a part of each and use in moderation when the time is right.\n\nGood luck!

__label__5 , Is linux suitable for first time (elderly) computer user?,If so, which distribution would you recommend? (given the fact that you would be the first they call with problems),Ubuntu is a great way to go. It is free, and they will even send you free CD's if you can't download it for some reason (if you are asking a question here, I assume you are already online). For me, the best part of Ubuntu is the community. There is a great community of people from around the world, that are very polite and always happy to help answer any questions that you may have: http://www.ubuntuforums.org\n\nEven though Ubuntu is currently on version 5.1 (Breezy Badger), http://ubuntuguide.org which was written for version 5.04 (Warty Warthog), is still a great guide that is very helpful as well.\n\nThe Synaptic Package Manager makes it VERY easy to install additional programs, and most of them are free.\n\nThere is a live CD (which runs from the CD), if you would like to try it without having to install it to your hard drive first:\nhttp://mirror.mcs.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu-iso/5.10/\n\nGive it a try, I am sure that you will like it. I installed Ubuntu as a dual-boot about 5 months ago, and I finally removed Windows about two months ago. I am here to stay.
__label__10 , If cops contest your right to free speech&assembly &arrests claiming you're nuisances,what right matters most?,used these abbreviations to fit Q in the Q-box: right= constitutional right; cops=law enforcement officials; nuisance=public nuisance\nmy file reference: TWH 11302006-1Q,Whatever all that Q stuff means.  Cops do not contest rights, they enforce the law.  If you break a law, even if you feel its a violation of your rights, the cops can do nothing about it...the decision as to whether it is a violation or you will be punished is in the jurisdiction of the court to decide.\n\nTake a good luck at the work of Martin Luther King Jr. with peaceful civil disobedience.  If you get involved in an issue regarding civil rights, you must be willing to be arrested.  Peaceful civil disobedience has several facets.  One, you do not resist arrest.  Two, if arrested you stay in jail as the goal is to fill the jails (hit the government where the money is).  Three, when you do get out, you go back out and do it again.  Four, you tie up the court system.  Sooner or later the issue will be adjudicated at the Supreme Court level which is the ultimate goal.  GBU\n\nOkay, since we are having some fun with this.  In my opinion the predominant right in any given situation if the Freedom of Speech...without which, btw, we would not be sitting here answering Q's.

A third function of the CIA is to act as the hidden hand of the government by engaging in covert operations, some of questionable legality, at the direction of the President. [1] It is this last function that has caused most of the controversies regarding the CIA over the years.
__label__2 , how can you tell if you are living in a parallel universe?,,You are, always a different one.\n\nEvery time a decision is made somewhere, the universe divides into the number of possible outcomes. Since the universe is infinite, then an infinite number of decisions are made, and therefore there are infinite numbers of alternate universes forming every second. Our consciousness as we experience it follows its own course determined by the decisions we make. Thus, we are always and will always be unaware of passage through these universes.\n\nAlso, think of it this way:  in an alternate universe Hitler won World War II. Do you think you exist there? How different do you think you are? Our present universe and that one have diverged, probably far.

__label__7 , i dont know how to save money,?,i have a new car and house and a nice job, but i reallt dont know how to save money, if i have money i always end up spending it.,Well first of all, that is not a question, it is a statement.  Yet I am going to assume that you are trying to say How can you save money? and will answer that question.  I'm sure you have heard of saving 10% of every paycheck and put it into long-term saings.  This is the most important concept in investing and savings.  Yet for most people it is impossible to find space in their budgets.  The only way for many people that this works is to put the money directly into a CD (certificate of deposit - a type of bank account).  This way it is not at all tempting to spend it when you get it.  There is a way to get this done automaticaly, yet I don't really know how (I am 15).  \n\nAll of this is explained in the book The Wealthy Barber by David Chilton.  If you were to only read one book in your life, this one is the one you should read.  It goes through basic savings and investment skills while putting it in a way that is entertaining and simple to understand.  Everyone should read this book and everyone can accieve a happy retirement if they follow the advice put forth by Dave.  It is amazing how simple the suggestions that he says are to implement.

But we shouldn't give up, as this is not an ultimate answer, it's only what the past measurements and observation told us. Further inquire and more accurate experiments are in preparation by the various space agencies, using robotic probes.\nFor instance, the European Space Agency is preparing two Martian probes: ExoMars and Mars Sample Return.\nExoMars foresees a rover equipped with many experiments for studying the biological features of the Martian environment.\nMars Sample Return will collect soil samples to be returned to Earth for even more accurate laboratory analysis.\nIn both cases, the idea is that Martian microorganisms or some traces of them (if they exist) may have escaped the previous observations.\nYou can find more details at the following links.

__label__10 , why is president bush pushing so hard for this port deal?,why is president bush pushing so hard for this port deal, if these are American ports y dont american companies bid for them, y the push for UE to run them,Please do note that this was not a deal that the administration cooked up.   It was a sale of a business by a private company which required, like many other sales involving work in the U.S., review by the administration to make sure it meets legal muster.  Nor was the deal covert -- it was made public several months ago (when the leading bidder for the London company's business -- a Singapore company-- withdrew their offer).\n\nSo, as a matter of legal fairness, if the company has followed all the U.S. laws there is no proper reason to disallow the sale.   To do so, on no legal grounds, is to tell an Arab country which has, since 9-11 been very helpful in combatting terrorism (in precisely such areas as port security, esp. container inspection), that the rules we apply to all other nations don't apply to them.  That would also discourage other Arab countries thinking of co-operating with us from thinking it's worth doing so.\n\nThere may also be some specific ways the UAE has helped us in the past few years that the administration cannot, for security reasons, give details about  (i.e., you don't want to divulge what you know about terrorist groups you are pursuing, nor all the sources of that information, because that would put them at risk and dry up potential sources, who would fear being outted themselves).   Of course, the administration would want to CONTINUE to get this kind of help and nixing business sales might threaten such assistance going forward.\n\nAs for the question, 'why a UAE business, not an American one?'   Simple answer: NO American companies bid to purchase the London company's business.  They were welcome to do so.  But, in fact, there really are not any American companies vying to manage these port terminal operations.  And again, the administration was never pushing for Dubai Port Worlds to make this purchase.  That agreement was made between the parties before the U.S. government had any involvement in the matter.\n\nFinally, it would be wise to inform yourself about what exactly the business is, who would be doing the actual work etc.  (Short answer -- it is basically about loading and unloading boats in specific port terminals, NOT running the entire port, much less port security;   the on site workers will continue to be the AMERICAN dock workers who worked for the London company selling the business.)\n\nThese, any a few other points, were made (more clearly) in an email from Bush administrations officials a couple of weeks ago.   I don't have a copy of the full text, but a number of excerpts may be found at the link below.

I have run into many problems like this while doing re-installs for customers.\n\nFirst make sure you have connection to the internet. It might be hard with your screen at 600 X 480 resolution. Make sure service pack 2 is installed through Windows Update. \n\nOnce that is complete, right click on My Computer then click on properties.  Your System Properties window pops up. Click on the Hardware Tab, then click on Device Manager.  Here you will find all of your hardware on your computer.\n\nFind your Display Adapter and click on the + sign to expand it.  Then right click on the display adapter and click Update Driver...\n\nFollow the wizard and let Windows search online for the driver.  Sometimes this takes a while, but eventually Windows will find the correct driver and install it.\n\nAfter a restart ??probably??, right click anywhere on the desktop to go to the display properties.  Go change your settings from 600 X 480 to something higher to make the screen look better.\n\nAfter that, you should go back to the Device Manager and make sure there are no yellow circles with exclamation marks on other devices.  If there are, right click on the device and Update Driver again like the Display adapter.  Then you should be all right.\n\nThe reason I say you should have service pack 2 installed is that in service pack 1, I don't think Windows would look for the driver online or I didn't have any luck with it.\n\nIf you don't have connection to the Internet, check your Device Manager to make sure your network adapter is installed.  I have run into situations when Windows would not install the network adapter for older system.  Then you have to do some research and find the right driver on the Resource CD provided by Dell.  Once you find the right driver and install it, then you can get connected and start the process from the beginning.  \n\nTIP:  Once you get your system re-installed they way you like it, get a software program such as Acronis True Image and make an image of the hard drive to a set of CDs/DVDs or external hard drive.  When disaster occurs again, just re-image the drive back to your original state with your disks!\n\nHope this helps!

He is really burnt out and would like to do something else totally different that what he does now, that would pay as much if not better than his salary now. He doesn't know what to else to do. Any advise??,Does he have an interest, or a hobby?\n\nOften times, these tough questions are right under our noses?\n\nCan he teach in a college? I assume he has some degree in counseling.\n\nHas he thought of volunteering for some charity that inspires him? Many people make the switch that way.\n\nIs he not considering the good relations he has with people in and outside of his job? Has he asked people he knows about their jobs, any openings, and how he might make a change?\n\nHowever, if the salary thing is an issue, then maybe he isn't ready yet. It's just that a career change also has to involve a change of spirit and attitude. If you are going to a career you've never done before, then you will definitely be eating some humble pie.\n\nTake it from me. After 15 years at my last job, I was completely burned out and very unhappy, stressed, and confused. Keeping an open mind got me a new career. While the pay is slightly less, I am very happy doing what I'm doing, so, ask your hubby to consider that also.\n\nIt is a really positive step forward and I would advise your bubby to keep his mind open.

__label__5 , diffrence between hardwired & microprogrammed control?,computer organisation & architecture,Hardwired systems are made to perform in a set manner, implemented with logic, switches, etc. between any input and output in the system. Once the manner in which the control is executed, you can not change the behavior of the system.\n\nMicroprogrammed systems are centered around a computer of some sort, often a microcontroller in small systems, that controls the system using a program. Input is sent to the computer, and the program determines what should be done with the input to come up with an output. So the processor is between the input and the output, rather than a direct link between the input and output.\n\nThe vesatility of the microprogrammed system far exceeds the hardwired system. The systems can also be considerably smaller. The size of a complex microcontroller can be quite a bit smaller that a bunch of logic and switches for the same functionality.\n\nThis what you were looking for?
__label__10 , How can i as a minor become an adult at the age of 16?,,You would need to be granted emancipation by a court.  \n\nEmancipation laws vary by state and not all states have an emancipation statute, which doesn’t mean that you can’t petition for it, because you can pretty ask the court for whatever you want, but in those states there is no actual ‘procedure’ in place.\n\nYou need to check the laws of your state. At a minimum you would be required to prove that you are capable of fully supporting yourself--paying for rent/utilities/food/medical expenses/etc with no assistance from anyone. You would also have to provide a *valid* reason that emancipation would be in your best interest. The court could require other things as well.\n\nThe court can deny emancipation for any reason that it sees fit, including, but not limited to, their belief that you lack the maturity/ability to function as an adult.\n\nGenerally speaking, it is not a quick or easy process, and more often than not, it is denied.

__label__2 , How do X-ray machines work?,,An X-ray machine is essentially a camera. Instead of visible light, however, it uses X-rays to expose the film. \nX-rays are like light in that they are electromagnetic waves, but they are more energetic so they can penetrate many materials to varying degrees. When the X-rays hit the film, they expose it just as light would. Since bone, fat, muscle, tumors and other masses all absorb X-rays at different levels, the image on the film lets you see different (distinct) structures inside the body because of the different levels of exposure on the film. \n\nIf you want to know how X-rays themselves work try the site below.

The Red Cross defers acceptance of blood from donors in this risk group.. even those in monogomous relationships.  IV drug users, being a or using prostitutes for sexual intercourse are other donor-risk behaviors.\n\nOther factors that would bar you from giving blood include: \n\n** You have had a recent tattoo.  \n\n **You or someone in your family has or had Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease. \n\n** You had an injection of beef insulin made from cattle in the United Kingdom.  \n\n **You recently had malaria.  \n\n **You have lived in the United Kingdom for more than three months or in Europe for more than six months anytime after 1980.  \n\n **You have been treated for syphilis or gonorrhea in the last year.\n\nAbout Blood Donation:\n\nBlood Facts:  http://www.miblood.org/about_blood/facts.html\n\nThe average adult has about 10 pints of blood in his or her body. \n\nThe Need For Blood \n\n4.5 million Americans would die each year without life saving blood transfusions. \nOn average, about 38,000 pints of blood are used each day in the United States. \nEvery three seconds someone needs blood. \nOn average, one out of every 5 hospital patients will need blood. \nAbout three gallons of blood supports the entire nation's blood needs for one minute. \nBlood centers often run short of type O and B blood. \nThe average red blood cell transfusion is 3.4 pints. \n\nHow Blood Helps\n\nOne unit of blood can be separated into several components (red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, platelets and cryoprecipitate). \nJust one pint of donated blood can help 3-4 people.
__label__2 , why is snow white and ice transparrent?,,While snow is ice it is not as dense as normal ice or an ice cube.  The molecules in an ice cube have formed without much air, which allows them to bond very closely to each other when water turns into a solid.  Snow on the other hand forms in air and the molecules are not as densely packed - which gives it many edges to refract light and thus the white appearance.

From there on it is only a matter of regaining his fitness and for that he will be using an oxygen tent which worked wonders for David Beckham.

__label__2 , why alkaline buffer is mostly used in protein separation? state its importance?,role of alkaline buffer in protein separation,The usage of an alkaline buffer in a low pH matrix of proteins causes the proteins to migrate to collection nodes in a process called Electrophoresis.   Electrophoresis is the process by which more highly charged molecular structures are moved through an electrical field and leave the lesser charged elements behind.  \n\n  In separation processes using polyacrylamide gel, which is the most common matrix and used to separate relatively larger proteins.  The addition of a mildly alkaline pH leaves most of the proteins anionic and causes them to migrate to ionic nodes (much like the allergenic air filters)   \n\n  In summery alkaline pH substances are used to make proteins anionic so they can be separated using an ionic node.  \n\n  (thanks tho finding out stuff about this one was fun ^_^, and good luck)

Mutual Funds might provide a better answer as they have historical offered a higher rate of return.  Look for a company that has performed well year after year. (American Funds, Vanguard)

Is this method a really ood idea?,Visit this website for the article http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s1599675.htm,4 years ago I worked on carbon sequestration projects in Australia and internationally. This included researching biological, geological and ocean sequestration of CO2. \n\nThere are pros and cons of all these processes, but I see many more pros.  You only have to look at Statoil's Sleipner Project in Norway - They have been sequestering CO2 into high saline aquifers since 1996.\n\nThey have, in fact stopped 1 million tonnes of CO2 from entering the atmosphere per year, the equivalent emissions of a 150MW  coal fired power plant in the US.\n\nI think it is a great solution until we can move towards a hydrogen economy.
__label__3 , what are effective birth control options after age 30? Im 33 and the dr. wants me to find another method?,,you don't want to go with the shot, norplant, iud, if you want to get pregnant sooner, than later.  I'm 32, and I use the ring and I love it!  What is the reason for changing your birthcontrol?  If you smoke, it'll be of concern after age 35, though you should still quit if you do.  If it was because you got pregnant on the last one, you should definitely reconsider that type.  If it's simply because your doctor thinks you've been on it too long, but it works, and you're comfortable with it, get a different doctor.  Birth control changes take time to adjust to, and shouldn't be done for no reason.

__label__5 , Slow media player?,I have a fast, high spec computer, and everything else is running great and fast, but when I try to play movie clips of any kind, they take an age to start, around 30 - 45 secs sometimes. Very occasionally, about once every 10 clips, one will start straight away. Its not a copyright issue, as it does it with any free to download clips from the wen. Its not just windows media player, same happens if I try to open them in real player or similar. I have the latest versions of all software. Any suggestions?,the download is the key. if it happens when you  are watching streaming video (straight off the net) then its most likely to be a connection lag. this is where the download stream is not quick enough for the playing stream and it will pause to wait for more of the video to download before it tries to play it.\n\nonly option for that is to wait until it is fully downloaded before trying to play it, simply push the pause button until it no longer says buffering\n\nif its not downloaded video check that you have all the relelvant codecs installed as it may be searching the internet for them before attempting to play them. it also uses the first ones it can grab hold of instaed of finding an exact match.\n\nto test this theory find a programme called gspot and open it and point it to the video you are trying to play. this will tell you what the codec is and wether you have it on your system\n\nNOTE: this will only work for files already on your system, not streaming files

Oh, and two guys I went to school with:  one was named Tad Ladd, the other was Billy Tilley. And then there was Perry Phair. I guess I've known a lot of people with interesting names.\n\nOH!

__label__9 , why do guys have to make the first move?,seriously, why do us guys have to be the ones to start a conversation, keep up the conversation, flirt & ask them out?, why can't girls do it more often?, well I'm 18, gonna be 19 in a month, & I'm still virgin & haven't had a girlfriend, been out on a date or a one-night stand, I know that girls make the first move sometimes, but they never make the first move on me, I'm a shy person, but that doesn't mean I never approach girls, I usually approach them when they are alone, I'm not comfortable approaching them in front of people or if they are with their friends, plus I'm always scared of asking them for their number cause I don't wanna get a fake one or a made-up excuse that they can't give it out, which is obviously a rejection. Sometimes I wish it was a girl cause it seems more easy for them, cause in my opinion, if a good looking boy is shy or won't make the first move, he won't get girls, but if a good looking girl is shy, she willl still get a lot of boys,because it's natural human and animal behaviour, males have to make the first move ,hence better chance of passing on thier genes.

__label__1 , What does a Muslim mean Jesus was a Prophet, is the New Testament full of lies?,The problem I am having is that Muslims have told me they believe in the Old Testament and the New Testament and the Koran and that Jesus was a prophet but they don't believe what the New Testament says, as for instance 1 John chapter 2, the last chapter of Revelation, if anyone adds to the words of the prophesy of this book I will add to him the plagues written herein.  And scripture says test the spirits, if any spirit does not confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh, then that spirit is not of God.  Scripture notes a man said praise God who has give such power to men.  I read a Muslim believes Jesus when he says he is the way, but he also says he is the truth and the life.  He is Truth.   God is Truth.  So some of you say you believe in the Bible but we are not to add to the words of the prophesy of the book and it says so many things which contradict what you say.  I heard a Muslim say who says we believe in Jesus?  So how do I really know what Muslims believe?,Muslims say that they believe the Bible, but they do not. In fact, they deny that Christ was actually crucified. They refer to him as a prophet because to recognize him as the Son of God would completely invalidate their religion, certainly the Quran.\n\nI have friends who are Muslim and I can tell you they do not study the Bible. They only study the Quran, so they only know and believe its teachings.

__label__1 , Feminism: Do you fully support the feminist movement, in every apect?,To my great shock, I hear more and more of woman regretting the effects of the feminist movement on the marriages, famillies, carriers, and lives in general. In fact, I hear just as much, if not more, negative talk about the feminist movement from woman as from men. Do you fully suupport the feminist movement, in every aspect? Do you believe voting and money compensates for any other drastic changes in society and in your life? If you could, what would you change about the movement and it's effects? Do you ever long for the days of old when the Biblical roles of men and woman were held sacred? Please, be elaborate.,I think that to some extent the emancipation of women brought many positive things for us, females. However, some of us, got carried away and now prioritize their careers in front of family and personal life in general. At the end of the day, everyone has the right to choose his avenues of life, so I consider the feminist movements as something that has  elevated the equality of women and men. \n\nOf course it's proper that every woman gets educated, gets a Career and is able to be financially independent, but some women really overdo it and anything that is done  without moderation loses its positive aspects.

__label__6 , Who is the better QB Micheal Vick or Vince Young?,,Vick is and will remain better.  Vick can be a pocket passer it's just Atlanta never had any receivers who were good so he had no options...with Crumpler, he can pick apart an offense.  He can read defenses better than Young will ever be able to. And even when he can begin to do that in a game situation, defensive coordinators will just play a plain, vanilla scheme in the first half and after halftime, just throw all kinds of different looks at him to confuse the crap out of him.  NFL teams are athletic enough to put a spy on him and defensive tackles are smart enough to plug up the middle so he can't run, unlike USC's sorry OLIne in the Rose Bowl.  \nSo, it's not that Vick is so much better, it's just that Young will be that much worse.  Too bad, he's a good guy.

I was raised around guys (my cousins) and my dad is an Asst. Chief for our Fire Dept. so I grew up in that atmosphere so I've always been around guys.

My opinion is that people who are racist just hate. When tragedy hits and it comes down to me or thee, WE are in this together and hate goes out the window, at least for a moment. I wish in times where there is no disaster we could all remember we share the same DNA. Truth is that most of us aren't WHITE at all. I am of American Indian decent and look like a funeral lilly, where is the fair in that? My brother is dark as caramel so go figure. The most racist are the ones with the most to fear of being mixed! LOL. The solution is to just go ahead and pray for those who wrongfully persecute you and let karma do the rest. They will one day see the error of the racist way. Kind of like Hitler did. Live well and know not all crackers are racist. LOVES :} nana

__label__10 , Abortion: When is it right?,I have read a bit on the subject of Abortion and the ethics their of. My problem with understanding the issue is this:\n\nI understand the entire argumant of woman who believe it is their own body and may therefore decide what to do with it. I sympathize with those woman; rape, financial problems, and complications during pregnancy make their argumant very strong, but....\n\nWhen those woman have an abortion it is not neccesarily their own body they are protecting, but the body of another they are harming. Even if that body may only be a few cells it will in time become a full grown human being with the same basic human right (the right to live).\n\nSo the real question then is when do we ascribe those rights onto a child still being carried within its mother,Abortion is acceptable to most people if it happens because of:\n\nRape/Incest\nBaby will not survive after it is born\nMother's life is at risk if baby is born\n\nI do believe that abortion should be legal, with the exception of late-term (this is currently how it is now.)  I do NOT support abortion as a form of financial or birth control, as some use it for, and I would like to see children adopted instead, but I realize not everyone will be willing to do this, and may find other, less-satisfactory ways of aborting the baby.\n\nAbortions now are regulated and licensed.  If abortion were illegal, I do fear that back-alley abortions may start up again.  And if one woman is forced to do this, instead of going into a clean facility with properly-licensed people, and ends up getting a disease or dying from a improperly-performed procedure, that's one too many.\n\nTherefore I do believe that abortion be legal, safe and RARE.
__label__2 , If a whip breaks the sound barrier, how come it does not make that sonic boom cloud cone?,,The clouds appear for the same reason that clouds always form, namely, that the air has cooled to the point that the ambient water vapor condenses.\n\nThe first site explains in detail why the clouds are merely an effect of aerodynamics and pressure and not a literal visualization of a barrier penetration. The second link explains it further and then provides links to some really cool pictures of the effect.

__label__2 , What is the possibility of a software controlling the brain with electrical signals in 10-20 years time?,According to Pfizer's website, the brain can be controlled by electrical signals. Also, everything we sense goes through the brain, so in a sense it is possible to have a sense of reality with electrical signals pounding the brain. A good example would be the Matrix which plugs in humans to get energy from them by putting them in a dream world.,This is being done to a limited extent in vision research-People have had microelectrode arrays implanted on the surface of the visual cortex of the brain, connected to a video camera.  The signal from the video camera activates the visual cortex, and these people, many of who have no eyes at all, or totally destroyed optic nerves, are able to see simple objects.  Thus, it is a proven concept that electrical signal can feed in meaningful information, and that information can lead to behaviour changes.  For many years, simple electrodes have been used to elicit specific tastes, memories, musclular twitches, etc.  As to your specific question-in order to control people's behaviour..in other words to overcome their will and wishes, and make them do things, or think things, that the operator of the machine wishes, would require a very good understanding of what controls our actions, emotions, and thoughts.  It's very unlikely that we will be at that state in 10-20 years.  Perhaps in 50 years we will have a very basic understanding, and in 100 years a fairly good understanding.  At any rate, when we do understand that, then it would be a relatively simple step to control it electronically (since electronics is simpler than the brain, and would also be advancing over that 100 years).

__label__6 , What does it mean when a pitcher is in the stretch?,I hear the commentators talking about it all the time but I never figured out exactly what is and what it means.  How does it affect the pitcher/strategy?,It is when a runner is on base. The pitcher has to hold the runner on, meaning keep him close to first so he doesn't steal second. If he was in the wind-up (his regular motion), the runner could get an enormous jump to steal second. In the stretch, he holds the runner better. \n\nThe stretch is basically pitching without the wind-up. The pitcher comes to a set (hands come down to a point and he pauses) before raising his leg and going home. Compare that to a full wind-up and you'll notice a huge difference.

It is not contagious, and recent studies suggest that people with fibromyalgia may be genetically predisposedhttp://fmaware.org/fminfo/brochure.htm. It affects more women than men, with a ratio globally of 3-5:1. Fibromyalgia is seen in 3-10% of the general population, and is mostly found between the ages 20 and 50. The nature of fibromyalgia is not well understood, and there is no cure, though it can be managed.\nHistory\nFibromyalgia has been studied since the early 1800s and referred to by a variety of former names, including muscular rheumatism, neurasthenia and fibrositis. The term fibromyalgia was coined in 1976 to more accurately describe the symptoms, from the Greek my-, meaning muscle, and algia, meaning pain. \nFibromyalgia was once considered an autoimmune disorder, but laboratory results reveal no disturbanc

__label__1 , Origin of the phrase knock on wood?,I know I've heard the story before but have completely forgotten about it! Anyone know the origin of the phrase?,To touch wood or knock on wood is a superstition action to ward off any evil consequences or bad luck, perhaps because of some recent action you’ve taken or untimely boasting about your good fortune (“I’ve never been in danger of drowning, touch wood”); it can also be a charm to bring good luck.\nThe origin is unknown, though some writers have pointed to pre-Christian rituals involving the spirits of sacred trees such as the oak, ash, holly or hawthorn. There is, I’m told, an old Irish belief that you should knock on wood to let the little people know that you are thanking them for a bit of good luck. There’s also a belief that the knocking sound prevents the Devil from hearing your unwise comments. Others have sought a meaning in which the wood symbolises the timber of the cross, but this may be a Christianisation of an older ritual. It wasn’t always wood that was lucky: in older days, iron was also thought to have magical properties, and to touch iron was an equivalent preventative against ill-fortune.\nThe phrase itself is relatively modern, as the oldest citation for the British version of the phrase, touch wood, that I can find dates only from 1899. The American equivalent knock on wood is roughly contemporary, with my first example from 1905.

__label__9 , Am I the Maid of Honor or not??,My best friend is getting married. While talking about weddings one day, before she got engaged, she said that when she get married, I would be her maid of honor. She's now planning her wedding, and we talk about it at work all the time. My problem lies here... When over at a friend's house, I heard her sister say that she was walking down the isle with Ryan, which is the best man. My friend hasn't said that I wasn't going to be her maid of honor. I don't know if her sister is just assuming she's the maid of honor or if my friend really asked her? I don't know how to bring it up. Any suggestions?,It's a sensitive subject, but I say ask.  Being Maid of Honor isn't some achievement of a lifetime, but it is important.  There are things that the Maid of Honor normally helps take care of (bridal shower, bachelorette parties, random errands, etc.)  You don't want her thinking you are her Maid of Honor, but you're not planning certain things because you're not sure.  And just say that. I need to know so I can get started.  If not, that's ok, but I want to be clear.  I know, I had a similar problem when my husband proposed.  One of my friends thought she was going to be MOH and when I didn't say that, she asked me.  I answered, crisis averted, and she still danced at my wedding.
__label__6 , Why can't they show American Football games commercial free like they do World Cup games?,,First of all, to every one who has answered, the Soccer games (World Cup, MLS, etc.) are not less capitalistic than the football games.  Look in the corner of your screen and you will see that Kodak or Pepsi or whomever has paid for this portion of the game.  The announcers in Soccer games will even verbally tell you that this portion of the game is brought to you commercial-free by Nike.  \n\nThe truth is that the soccer clock doesn't stop.  A game changing play can occur at any time.  It would be potentially embarrasing for Soccer games to cut to a commercial and miss a goal.  \n\nAmerican Football, however, has plenty of pauses.  Whether it is after a score, during a time-out, or what is oddly referred to as a TV Time-out, the game isn't as dependant on the clock.  \n\nThis isn't to say that one is better than the other, but watching American Football without the brief pauses would get rather tedious.  \n\nBesides, if there weren't commercial breaks during Football games, when would I get up to get myself a beer?
__label__9 , Why is he mad at me?,My Ex bf dumped me last month.  We told each other that we loved each other and wanted to spend the rest of our lives together.  We didn't fight, we got along great.  We had amazing chemistry and loved to talk about anything.  We had a lot in common, ect... then his ex gf asked him to come back to her.  They dated off and on for a year and a half.  So, he chickened out on me and ran back to her.  I was devestated and can not understand how he would give up what we had.  He claims that she is the love of his life.  BUT.... I know this isn't true.  I know that he told other people how he felt about her when they last dated, and he told me the same thing.  He said she was comfortable and he could marry her, why not.  With me, he said he loved me like no other, but that he was afraid that love was just blind.... What the heck?  Anyhow, I was having a hard time and thought that I should remind him how I felt and that I wanted him to come back. In the beginning, I texted him and emailed him a lot.  Then a couple weeks later, he got mad at me.. I asked him if he was mad at me because we were going to try to be friends. He said, Yes, I asked you to leave me alone.  Please leave me alone.  I was reallyl shocked because he never asked me to leave him alone.  So, I went to his house, after not seeing him for two weeks.  I talked to him.  He admitted that he loved me still, but he made his choice.  He claimed it wasn't easy since he loved everything about me, but he had a history with her.  So, we talked, I kissed him on the cheek and I told him I would wait, then left.  He nodded with his eyes swollen and full of tears.  I thought that was a good sign.  So, two weeks after that, I find out they are gonna get married next month.  I was like, wow, he really should not do that.  I sent him an annonomous text message saying , You don't marry the one you can live with, you marry the one you can't live without. I think it's a big mistake to marry her just so he won't be alone.  So, he texted me back saying I was a harrassing, psychotic stalker!  Wow, I was shocked again. I mean, I have left him alone like he asked for two weeks.  I didn't think sending a text message constitutes a stalker. So, I know he is reallyl angry at me.   I just don't know why?  Is it because he knows it's true and he doesn't want to be reminded, or does he really all of a sudden hate me and want me completely out of his life, when we had said we would be friends down the line.,I think that he is torn between 2 different women and he had to decide to choose--- unfortunately he did not choose you.  The other women is probably controlling and has talked him into getting married.  I would say he does not want to talk to you any more b/c of the simple fact that he is ashamed, doesn't want to hurt you anymore and because he probably b/c he also doesn't want to hurt this other girl.  Just give it sometime and see what pans out more than likely if there wedding is a ways off she will probably leave him like she did before... at that point in time if he truly loved you he will come back to you b/c he will have realized what he lost.  I would say even though he is saying hurtful and mean things more than likely he isn't mad at you and is only doing what he is doing b/c he is ashamed of what he did or the crazy other women could have his cell phone and is texting it without his knowledge.  Anyways good luck and if you do happen to find another great guy in the mean time at least give them a chance maybe all of this just happened for a reason.

The GPS system might use the curvature of the earth to modify the length of what the system describes as a meter, because a curved meter spans a shorter distance along one axis.  The length of a meter is immutable and is defined as: the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second where the speed of light, c, is 299,792,458 m/s.

__label__6 , I'm a John Cena fan but don't you see a change in his attitude lately? Do you think he will turn heel soon?,If you watch 5 questions he is always making little comments that are a little insulting & he seems to be defending his sexuality lately he is always making comments about women or (tag teams) if you understand what he is taking about. (This has nothing to do with wrestling tag teams.) I don't know he has changed quite a bit lately like he is irritated or something?,Personally, I believe alot of the face wrestlers get tired of being faces, he might be getting bored with his character. I wouldn't blame him, his face character isn't that appealing to today's crowd except to youth and teenage girls (mostly), because wrestling fans today don't want the boy scout face character nowadays like they did before with people like Hulk Hogan, fans nowadays are more realistic and like their face wrestlers to have more attitude than that, that is why The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin were so popular.  I am not a fan of John Cena, but I think that his wrestling character was the best when he was a heel or when he wasn't the top face. It is very possible that he doesn't like being the top face in the WWE, I mean it is alot of pressure to put on someone and alot of the past people who have had that spot have suffered either physically or emotionally because of it. I would like to see him turn face again. In fact, I know how it should happen. I think Randy Orton should win the Royal Rumble, face John Cena at Wrestlemania 23 for the WWE Title, and during it John gets frustrated that he is not able to beat Randy so he does stuff that makes him turn heel. Eventually Randy Orton would win the match and it would not only start a rivalry (which I think could become the next Austin-vs.-Rock), but also effectively have them switch places to where Randy is a face and John is a heel. I hope that answers your question.
__label__5 , What are Type of digital currencies?,,What you may be referring to are so-called virtual currencies that exist in many network based multi-player games like Diablo 2.\n\nIn Diablo 2, a standard (very fun and well designed) hack-and-slash fantasy game, you can gain gold be going around a killing things. Since the game is multi-player a high level character can log on with a low level character and give them lots of money.\n\nThis has brought up a question of how these digital currencies and virtual economies will work. One main question is How will inflation work in an economy that is continually producing more money? If the high level characters are constantly racking up huge amount of gold and giving it away, what makes the game difficult anymore? Many theoretical solutions have been proposed, but none has proven to be the magic bullet that solves the problem.\n\nAnother type of digital currency is the money you're holding in your bank account. Most middle class people hold money in bank accounts rather than cash, and very few will go and withdraw all of that money at once. As a result, banks take that money and lend it out elsewhere, rarely holding more than 5-10% of the original amount in actual cash. Since this is a practice of most banks, most of the money in the economy is actually virtual, going back and forth between in digital ones and zeros across the internet; very little is kept in cash form.
__label__4 , Education in the US of A: how are languages learned?,Hello, on the french yahoo answers, someone was saying that, in the US, kids do not have to learn any foreign language.. What is the situation? What languages are available for the kids to learn, what percentage actually learns one? Etc...,I took a miliatry language class in the Army (Russian) and one of our instructors told us, There are more teachers in Russia, teaching English, than there are students in the US, learning Russian, not too hard to figure out, Russian isn't offered in most American High Schools. However, this is part of a larger problem.\n\nThe typical American High School (grades 9-12) offers French, German. and Spanish. Some others offer Japanese and Latin, but that's about it. Russian, Chinese, Italian, Dutch, Farsi, etc., are completely ignored.\n\nMost American High Schoolers are required to at least TAKE a foreign language course, They don't have to be proficient, but they do have to get credit, in order to graduate. By contrast, in Holland, where they speak Dutch, students are REQUIRED to learn English.\n\nAs far as how many US students go on to become language teachers, work for the government in the Diplomatic Corps, or as an interpeter for the U.N., I dont have exact figures but I would guesstimate maybe .25% (one quarter of one percent)
__label__6 , Why are Australia's colors in the World Cup green and yellow and not the colors on their flag?,,Well I have read all the responses so far and I must say that some are very amusing, but so far only one of these is close.  That is this one:  ( the real answer is at the bottom please read on.)\n\nGreen and gold are the national colours of Australia, as proclaimed by Sir Ninian Stephen, the Governor General of Australia on 19 April 1984. The exact colours were specified as being Pantone Matching System numbers 116C and 348C. Green and gold are also the traditional team colours of Australian national sporting teams. Nearly every current Australian national sports teams wears The Green and Gold, although the hues and proportions of the two colours may vary between teams and across eras. It is widely believed that the colours were chosen because they are the dominant colours of Australia's floral emblem, the Golden Wattle.\n\nYou will find that every major Australian national team wears green and gold including most notably the two time world champion Wallabies of Rugby, the Socceroos of the World Cup, and the Olympic team. \n\nSource(s):\n\nwikipedia.org \n+++++ \n\nReal Answer:\nThe official colours of Australia are BLUE AND GOLD... (Not Green and Gold, Green and Yellow, or any other colours of the rainbow or anything else that the so called greenies or hippies or even other minority group may wish to conjure up.  If you go to Parliment House and read the constitution ( not that many of obviously have or have the ability to) you will find amongst the small print that the national colours for the reprsentaion of this great land of ours called Australia are Blue and Gold... the reason that we portray Green and Gold is for our sporting teams and that is due to the above mentioned clours of the Wattle flower and tree. \n\nNow before you so called experts try to smack me down with all your references and alke I suggest you visit the National Capitol and see the constitution for yourself. Also take the time to read it (if your able to that is  and you will no doubt see that I am correct and you are misinformed..) \n\nI hope that this had shed a bit of light on your dilemma or at least given more ammunition for a good arguement as I really do enjoy that..

__label__1 , if a girl wears guy clothes , its normal(pantsshirt etc) but when a guy wears  girl clothes, hes a crossdressr,,It is the social perception - based on thousands of years of observation - that women are able to act in entirely non-sexual behaviors while men do not. A man wearing women's clothing is perceived as being frustrated sexually, so frustrated that he is attempting to be attractive to other men in the hope/expectation of sex. However, women are not perceived as sex pursuers, and so are free to wear men's clothing - or any clothing they want. It is a double standard, but like most double standards with women and men, we can be thankful for it.

__label__3 , Salvia, does anybody know anything about it?,,The best range of temperatures for growing salvia plants is about 60-80 degrees Fahrenheit, they can tolerate much colder (Almost freezing temperatures) but plant growth slows at the extremes of its preferred range. Growing salvia is also made a good deal easier when you take steps to preserve the plants’ natural affinity to moisture in the air. This can be done by frequently misting your growing divinorum plants with clean water from a garden-mister. This is also an ideal way to clean the leaves of your salvia divinorum plants from any dirt or bugs. Salvia divinorium also grows very well in a humidity tent, that is a greenhouse like setup that traps moisture and heat but lets in light to the plants. Simply wrapping plastic wrap from the lights overhanging your growing salvia divinorium plants will be sufficient. \n\nCare of salvia divinorum plants\nRemember that salvia plants will begin to grow quite slowly at first, and every time you move a divinorum plant from one pot to another there will be a slow down in the salvia plants’ growth until it has time to recover and adjust to the new growing environment. The larger the plant typically the faster the rate of growth and recovery from transplantations and other stresses, fertilizer generally will help speed this process up also. Make sure, when growing salvia divinorum plants for leaf mass, to use a big enough, otherwise the growing plants roots will be constricted and you will get a smaller yield of salvia divinorium.\n\nSalvia divinorum plants have very weak stems, that are prone to breaking in half when they get too tall to support the weight of all the leaves. When the stem breaks if it is in contact with the soil, as it often is since the plant usually bends over as it breaks, the stem will root in the soil and the salvia plant will survive and you can continue growing salvia.\n\nThere are two different strains commonly available in salvia divinorum plant cuttings from vendors, the first specimen brought back to the new world was called hoffman and wasson and it’s the smallest and host hardy of the salvia strains currently being grown. The other most popular variety of growing salvia is blosser/palatable this is the most recent specimen retrieved from mexico (in 1990) and its reportedly easier to eat because it has a much less bitter taste

__label__1 , How could I promote my organization: Youth for Change to help Christian youth of Pakistan?,The Christians in Pakistan are about 2% of its population. The Christian youth needs help to learn job skills and educate themselves -- they need lot of information on the kind of education they should go for in order to excel in it. They need business education so that they could initiate their own businesses and find success in it. They need to learn internet and English to enhance their knowledge. There is a need to help male students to find better education and  better job so that they could marry with the well literate Christian females, at present there is an unbalance among the sexes at that level which has created social problems . At present there is a need to motivate young people to take up their responsibilities and work hard at it. We would like to work for female youth empowerment and development as well. If the youth is not helped in their soical problems they will become further poor and also will be very depressed and will lose interest in the Church work & society.,Take the help of Gen Musharraf but don't agree if he offers to open Madrassas for Christians in Pakistan or he'll turn them into  Jehadis!

__label__7 , let say i have a credit card for limit of a 1000.00 and i make a puchase under. how would they base my payment,and if i went over my $1000.00 credit card limit, how would they base my payment.,Check your agreement, or any billing statement.  It spells that out exactly.\n\nThe minimum payment is typically 2.5% to 5% of the ending balance, usually with a minumum of $10.00 or so.  There has been pressure from lawmakers to raise the minimum payments lately to help get people out of debt more quickly.\n\nAnything over the credit limit is also due immediately, as are any late fees or over-limit fees.\n\nSo, if your credit card has a 4% minimum payment and you were right at the $1,000 limit, your payment would be $40.00.  If you went over your limit by $100.00 and they charged you a $30.00 over-limit fee, your minumum payment would be:\n\n$44.00 (4% of $1,100.00) plus\n$30.00 (over-limit fee) plus\n$100.00 (amount you are over the limit)\n\n$174.00 (total minimum payment due)

__label__9 , Help! i have a girl friend and she have told our love to her father. Her father was not accepting likely w 2 d,have spoke to him 3 times and i have also told that we had sex and i wl not marry other girl as i feel she is my wife. Though telling this her father is telling that he will take this issue to his relations and if they accept he will accept for our marriage else he will not. Iam unable 2 think a life without her and she loves me like anything. For the past 20 days they are not letting her outside(even to office) and not giving the phone calls to her. She also not made any call still now and iam getting mad. Iam a typical guy who always think only one girl in my life and i don't want to take my life with some other girl. Her father told to me that he will go to his native in april and let me know the output in the month of may. I think he will prob take her to native and live her there. I don't know her native place also. I want to talk to her but if they come to iam in the line the problem will explode much. Pls advice what to do in this regard. Thxin advance for ur help and advice.,Hopefully, you are both over 18.  If she loves you like you say, then as an adult she is going to have to make a choice.  He can't force her to go somewhere without her consent.  While I realize that her culture is different, she is going to have to stand up to her father.  Unfortunately, if she doesn't stand up to him and goes with him, then there is not a lot you can do except forget her.  Do not do anything drastic or stupid.  You could end up in trouble.  The next step is up to her.  Good luck!

How can American people just turn a blind eye to daily proof of the US government direct involvemnet in the ugliness that seems to be the main focus of America.?,When you live in a dictatorship, as we do in America the party in power will always steal tax payer funds.\nAmerica is spending $6 billion a month in Iraq.

__label__5 , Just how good is my Wireless Router?,My wireless router sometimes seems to lose the connection for a moment, and then it's back.  How do I test this?,In general, if you don't really need a wireless router, then don't get one.   The old fashioned wire is more reliable, less costly to buy, less costly to maintain and more secure from intrusion. You grow fond of the wires that run all over your house. If you do use a wireless router, Use the Security Features, and Write Down the Passwords.\n\nOpen the Command Prompt from the Accessories folder, found in the Programs section of your Start Menu \nType this IPCONFIG command, followed by the ENTER key to display your computer's IP configuration.\n\nC:&#92;>ipconfig\n\nUse the PING commend to PING the gateway address 1,000 times, using the following command:\n\nC:&#92;>ping 192.168.0.1 /n 1000\n\nThis simple test will tell you how many times your router did not answer.  This 15 minute test will give you a good handle on if your router is reliable.  (other than simply signal strength).

As someone with experience I can tell you these tools are a way for the provider/author to make money. Your reps, however, will not learn. Some will resent it, others will be happy just not to be working/at their job.\n\nThe best training is always having them practice their art, monitoring them and providing peer/supervisor feedback and creating a positive environment where the reps are happy and therefore motivated.

__label__9 , My dad and i do not get along what do i to have to do to have a good father and daughter relationship?,I really hate my dad because he teases me about watching too much T.V, i can't help it if i like T.V i just love watching my favourite T.V shows and movies, the main reason why he teases me is because all the things i watch he thinks is rubbish, even my mum thinks so but she doesn't give nasty comments i don't want to hear like my dad does, all i want my dad to do is to leave me and my T.V alone and no comments as well he always likes to ebbarras me in front of my friends when having sleep overs, he walks in and says So what's this rubbish your wathing? and every time i say something to defend myself dad thinks i'm giving him cheek! i mean what am i suppose to do? just sit there and let him throw nasty comments in my face!! no i wont i will get up and say to my dad Dad shut up I said it once and i will say it again stop it with the comments! I'll bet i will get in trouble after that! but i will feel good after doing it my dad needs a really good spanking does everyone agree with me,One of my professors in college stated to me:if you want to see a change in others...you might start with yourself\n\nDon't REACT to situations(unless you have to run for your life, etc), but think first. \n\nMaybe ask him why he does not respect what you are watching(but DON'T raise your voice), ask him softly(like a woman). Tell him you want a better relationship with the only father you have, and ask him also what does he think that could be done to bring you closer. Maybe include your mother in on this. Sometimes it is the child who becomes the teacher. Start somewhere with small bites...try to make a joke when adversity strikes, or even smile. It disarms the other person, and calms the situation.

As long as they remain a diversion and not the sole focus of your activity, sex toys are great when shared.
__label__9 , Is a St. Christopher medal necklace too boyish?,I am getting married in August we both have children (him a 7 year old boy, me a 8 year old girl).  We are getting them both a gift when we get married.

__label__10 , How many ethnic conflicts have occurred since the end of WWII?,Thank you for your responses. I am more curious about a numerical quantity, however. At the top of the 1990s, for example, there were 93 ethnic conflicts in 70 states, according to Canadian Military reporting. A dataset would be most helpful.(http://www.iwar.org.uk/military/resources/csis/conflict.htm),honestly i think that you aren't going to be able to find an exact # or even a estimate. theta is the hardest thing to do. but if you are looking for a specific case then that shouldn't be hard, but fining a tally of cases is hard especially if you are not working in a law office and have the database they have.a case is easier to find and it will only take five minutes as opposed to a whole life time.

__label__10 , Who should be making decisions for the people?,Who should be running government and making decisions for the people - smooth talking politicians or objective scientists?,In a true democracy, the people rule.\nWe live in a republic, a country ruled by elected representatives.\nActually, that wouldn't be all bad if those elected representatives would remember that they're there to serve the PEOPLE. But, our corrupted two-party system has turned into a monopoly - a stranglehold on the way government works. We are governed by Republicrats who only want to play, Let's Make A Deal' with taxpayers' money.\nAmerican consumers have multiple choices on everything from cars to cucumbers, but when it comes to electing public leaders to serve the people, we get stuck with limited choices. It's time for new, fresh political parties to come into the national consciousness, and really change the way we elect politicians.\n-RKO-

__label__6 , were was volleyball invented?,,On February 9, 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts, William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created a new game called Mintonette as a pastime to be played preferably indoors and by any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics from tennis and handball. Another indoor sport, basketball, was catching on in the area, having been invented just ten miles (sixteen kilometres) away in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts only four years before. Mintonette (as volleyball was then known) was designed to be an indoor sport less rough than basketball for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.

Macross), Gigantor, Pokemon, Digimon, Zatch Bell, Naruto, One Piece, Cowboy BeBop, Outlaw Star, Voltron, Transformers, Trinity Blood, Bleach, InuYasha, FullMetal Alchemist, Dragonball, Dragonball GT, Crayon Shin-Chan, Super Milk Chan, Case Closed (better known as Detective Conan), Gundam (several different series), Candidate for Goddess, Ghost in the Shell, Evangelion, several Studio Ghibli movies (Princess Mononoke, Porco Rosso [I think], Spirited Away), Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo, Thundercats (which may not count because it was made in Japan for the American market), Big O, FLCL, Lupin III, Paranoia Agent, S-Cry-Ed, Eureka Seven, possibly Escaflowne, .hack//, Read or Die, Zoids, Samurai Champloo, Yu Yu Hakusho.  The list goes on and on (trust me).\n\nThere have been other shows (I can't remember them all), but I do know that Toonami started out as mostly (if not all) anime and led off with (believe it or not) Sailor Moon for awhile.  There are lists on Wikipedia (see the first two links), but I don't think anyone separated out the anime from the rest of the cartoon shows.

__label__5 , award bootblock bios?,,Once in a while a BIOS flash fails or, for any number of other reasons, your BIOS becomes corrupt, you will find that your system will not boot. With newer BIOS releases you may receive a screen that the AWARD BootBlock BIOS is attempting recovery and that it's searching for a diskette. For example:\n\n\nAward BootBlock BIOS v1.0\nCopyright (c) 2000, Award Software, Inc.\n\n\nBIOS ROM checksum error\n\n\nDetecting floppy drive A media\n\n\nWith older BIOS' (and at other times) your system will appear to be dead, with the exception that it attempts to boot from the diskette drive and then hang.\n\nIn the above scenarios, your BIOS is probably corrupt and the system is attempting to read the floppy. In these cases the BootBlock is attempting to recover your BIOS. The BootBlock is a portion of the BIOS which will sometimes boot when the BIOS itself has been corrupted to enable you to boot to a floppy and reflash. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nIn order to attempt the reflash, prepare a DOS boot diskette with no CONFIG.SYS (remember: if you prepare a boot diskette in Windows, CONFIG.SYS may be hidden by default, so it will be necessary to change your view settings in order to see it).\n\nDownload the latest BIOS for your board and unpack it into a work directory on another system's hard disk. You'll get as many as five files. The two you are interested in are named xxxxxx.BIN (replace xxxxxx with the name of the BIOS .BIN file that you are attempting to flash) and AWDFLASH.EXE. Copy these two files to your DOS diskette.\n\nCreate a single line AUTOEXEC.BAT on the diskette containing:\n\nAWDFLASH.EXE xxxxxx.BIN /CC /CD /CP /F /R /PY /SN\n\nNote the spaces after .EXE and .BIN and before each / in the above command.\n\nPrior to flashing with your recovery diskette, remove the power cord and open up your computer (you're going to need to crack the case after the flash anyway in order to manually clear your CMOS). Disconnect all drives, except your floppy drive.\n\nSeveral users have reported back that they were able to recover from the BootBlock when advised to disconnect everything except the floppy drive.\n\nTo flash with this diskette, place the floppy in drive A:, power up your system and (hopefully) after several minutes your system should reboot itself. When your system reboots, press DEL at the POST screen and shut your system down. Because your BIOS was corrupt, you should clear your CMOS settings manually using the following procedure:\n\nRemove the main power cord.\nRemove the motherboard battery (optional).\nMove the Clear CMOS jumper (CCMOS1 on Abit boards) from pins 1 and 2 to pins 2 and 3.\nPress your power switch several times to discharge any remaining power from the motherboard.\nWait a minute or two.\nReplace the motherboard battery (if you removed it).\nMove the Clear CMOS jumper back to pins 1 and 2.\nReconnect your drives.\nClose up the case.\nRestore the power.\nPower up and press DEL during the POST to get into the BIOS setup screens and reenter everything.\n\nIn order to properly detect your CPU and memory, remember to start your reentry of BIOS settings with the selection of Load Optimized Defaults.\n\nDon't forget to remove the diskette (or you'll likely boot to it and run the flash all over again).\n\nYou should see what's happening on the screen with new motherboards. With many older boards, you will be running blind unless you have an ISA Video Card installed in your system.\n\nIf nothing happens and your floppy doesn't start to access after a few minutes, power down and try again - sometimes it takes several attempts to force the BootBlock to start running the flash.\n\nThe AWDFLASH.EXE command modifiers used above are:\n/CC = clear CMOS data after programming.\n/CD = clear DMI data after programming.\n/CP = clear PnP (ESCD) data after programming.\n/F = use flash routines in the BIOS for programming (force flash).\n/R = reset s

__label__5 , video card laptop upgrades?,My friend has a laptop, she needs to upgrade the video card I'm wondering if it's even possible,Unless your friend specifically bought a laptop that provides upgradeable video, such as some models from Alienware and VoodooPc, whatever video chipset came with the laptop is what she'll have to live with.  these are normally embedded on the motherboard, and aren't user-upgradeable.  \n\nthat said, if this is a fairly recent laptop (made within the last three years) and has at least an ATI Mobility Radeon or Nvidia GeForce2go with 16MB or 32MB of dedicated RAM, or it's a very recent laptop (made within the last year) with a good chipset using shared memory (Intel Extreme Grahpics 2), your friend should still be able to install some playable games on the laptop.  games for teens and adults (Doom 3, Quake 4, Civilization 4, Battlefield 2) probably won't be playable,but less strenuous and older games (Civ 3, Unreal tournament) and younger kids games should still work fine.

There is a flirtation between them nothing more than friendship... the girl wants to wait till marriage or engagement for sex  and the guy knows this... could this become a good relationship/marriage?,I don't think we should allow society to dictate age restrictions in relationships. There is a 21 year age gap between my boyfriend and I (I'm 27). I have never been happier in my life. Just like with any relationship, it needs to have the essentials like trust, understanding, communication, interests, goals, etc. If those elements are in place, then nothing else matters. Love is the greatest feeling in the world, and age shouldn't stop anyone from experiencing it.

When light hits a black object for example, the atoms of the object absorb the light, then radiate it back off at a longer wavelength (we feel this as heat).  Plants collect light using their leaves and convert it into chemical energy (food for the plant).  Photocells convert light to electricity.

And if you don't care, i want your opinion too. That question is for woman and a man. because some woman don't want have big girl for friend. P.S sorry for my bad english but i do the best i'm a french woman.,i am a big woman and have never had a problem with men. as a matter of fact it has been my experience whether or not they admit it most men like a bigger woman. just because society today makes it out like if your not skinny or the perfect size then no one will find you attractive. well thats just not true. beauty comes from within. you could be the prettiest woman in the world. but if you no personality or think you are gods gift to the world you wont be very attractive. And as for whether or not someone would be friends with a woman who was large in size. What FRIEND would judge your worth based on your looks. That person would have to be pretty shallow and therefore not worth having as a friend.

__label__3 , Is 183 a high number for someones blood sugar level?,,I am a type two diabetic, and my blood sugar was 540 the first time they took it.  Although, 183 is high, that can be controlled by what you eat.  If you cut the sugar out of most of what you eat it would be a good thing.  I mean the sugar you add yourself, as everything you eat has sugar in it.  And you need to watch your carbohydrates.  \n\nLook on any can or box and it will tell you the carbohydrates in a serving.  I was told that I could have 45 carbohydrates per meal and 15 for each snack, only 3 snacks a day.  Carbohydrates turn to sugar in your system.\n\nThis may help your blood sugar, but the wisest advice I can give is to see a doctor, I do not like to see them either, but had I not gone to one, I might have died from mine, and it is always better to know.  They can prescribe medicene in pill form to help keep your blood sugar low.\n\nGood luck to you.

__label__10 , What makes more sense-to take care of our own country's problems,or to go help other countries,uninvited??,,Take care of your own first unless your existence is being threatened.  Iraq never threatened the existance of the US.  It was the same thing I heard during the war in VietNam.  We have to fight them over there or else we'll have to fight them over here.  We lost the war and I still haven't seen that invasion by the Vietnamese.  30 years and still waiting.  And to I Hate Liberals.  More Iraqis have now died since we invaded the country than did under the reign of Saddam Hussein.  Also, why aren't you over there protecting America?  Chicken?  Just like your leader, George W. Bush.

__label__6 , Was Australia robbed by the ref. in the final minutes against Italy?,,the postings about 'italy's robbery' are a fine example of modern psychology's phenomenon, the so-called causal attribution error, meaning that if something positive occurs, it's due to one's own action, but if something negative occurs, it's the other's fault...\n\nthe socceroos will definately overcome their loss against italy and yes, it was a penalty-worth foul (as per the FIFA rules, a foul is considered worth a penalty if a player is obstructed by a member of the opponent team and it definately was an obstruction by the australian player), even though the ref's decision might me considered 'undecent', 10 seconds before the match might have gone into overtime...
__label__9 , Any good anniversary gift ideas?,My husband and I will be celebrating our 5th anniversary next week, and I want to give him something special.  Any ideas?,The traditional gift for the 5th anniversary is wood. If you are traditional then you should keep that in mind.  While it may sound boring, you will have to be creative.\n\nSince we are talking male gifts here then consider his hobbies and interests.  Does he love auto repair, cars, hunting, fishing, camping, sports, reading, is he a couch potato? does he love the outdoors or indoor type things?\n\nWhile you may think an oak frame with YOUR picture is a perfect gift, believe me he will not think so.  It is the equivalent of you getting a blender or toaster from him!\n\nFor traditions sake lets say.......he hunts.....a gun cabinet is nice.\nFishing........ a lure kit, to make his own lures.\nSports.....locate a signed bat via local papers (forget Ebay)\nCamping.....plan a camping trip  \n\nFor a non traditional gift..............try\n\nA coupon book.  One you make up yourself.  Do it on the computer.  Make coupons called Off the Hook .  Husbands are always looking for ways not to take the trash out, do the lawn or clean the garage or to simply lay around.\n\nYou can add sexy coupons.....one free no obligation massage.\nOne night of total ME...all about HIM, dinner, sports, sex while he watches sports.\nOne coupon you have to do anything I ask\n\nAnd YOU can't complain if he turns in his coupon!\n\nBe creative!  \n\nAs far as purchaseing a gift for him..........you can always do him a favor and buy him some tickets to his favorite team.  HE gets to chose his guest.\n\nThe anniversary itself is about you both.  So plan that special dinner and night on the town or private dinner at home.  The gift to one another should say that I know you are an individual.\n\nGood luck and Happy Anniversary

How do you do it, asked the lady bug? Do what, responded the centipede.\n\nYou know.. manage all those legs.. fifty on the left and fifty on the right.. it's amazing!\n\nThe centipede fell on his face.

__label__4 , what should i do?,i am wanting to experiment on twins for a science fair project and i dont know what to do it on but i did have an idea to do it on like a toy and expeiment on what toy they like bestbecause of the colors or something but i just need some help on deciding...,How about if you come up with a word-association test, where you ask them to say the first word that comes to mind when you say another word.  Do about 10 words, and test the twins separately (of course).  Then compare their tests and see if they said the same words (for example, if your word was cold and they both said ice cubes that could help you prove that twins are on the same wavelength or something.)  Also, instead of doing your project on twins in general, why don't you try to narrow down your research field, like maybe just do your project on identical twins or just fraternal twins, or whether twins think alike or whether they can sense the other twin's feelings, or something like that.  There are plenty of research books on the subject in the llibrary, and the Internet is always a great resource too.

I have dealt with a D-Link in my home which surprisingly covered the whole yard, over 2 acres (but its flat and the router was on the highest point). So D-Link is good. Linksys is good/fair. I never heard of Linksky though.\n\nAlso, make sure you get a router that broadcasts Wireless G. wireless B is kinda outdated and slower. It might be best to get a Pre-N router too.
__label__3 , What is triglecerides?,its a medical term my doctor told me that the result of my test this item was high.,Mine too.  Triglycerides are the chemical form in which most fat exists in food as well as in the body. They're also present in blood plasma and, in association with cholesterol, form the plasma lipids. \n\nTriglycerides in plasma are derived from fats eaten in foods or made in the body from other energy sources like carbohydrates. Calories ingested in a meal and not used immediately by tissues are converted to triglycerides and transported to fat cells to be stored. Hormones regulate the release of triglycerides from fat tissue so they meet the body's needs for energy between meals.\n\nHow is an excess of triglycerides harmful?\n\nExcess triglycerides in plasma is called hypertriglyceridemia. It's linked to the occurrence of coronary artery disease in some people. Elevated triglycerides may be a consequence of other disease, such as untreated diabetes mellitus. Like cholesterol, increases in triglyceride levels can be detected by plasma measurements. These measurements should be made after an overnight food and alcohol fast.

Republicans are disenfranchised with the Bush administration and Democrats are trying to cater to the conservative voter because of it's powerful force. The smarter of the two political candidates should tout themselves as a moderate rather than a conservative or liberal. Politically, I believe a moderate will win the White House in 2008. Realistically, I belive a Democrat will win the White House in 2008, UNFORTUNATELY.

Given the many uniform numbers retired by the Yankees, it is very likely his number would have been retired by them after his career ended anyway.

Do you know and understand the political, social, and economic history of the nation?  Do you take personal responsibility for the safety and well-being of your country (this idea blatantly stolen from Robert Heinlein)?

__label__6 , Was Englnds poor second half performance on saturday......?,due to the lack of options upfront?\n\nI think we have one of the best teams in the competition and were amazing in the first. The way we played in the second half worries the hell out of me though.\n\nAny thoughts?,Watching us play in the second half was so surreal it was like a bad dream,it did give us a seriously hot topic that's the talk of the land and 3 points so not as bad as all that and with the draw between Sweden and Trinidad top of the group. I don't have the faintest of what Sven was thinking,Without a striker to play onto Crouch becomes obsolete so if Owen had to come of putting Walcott on would have made more sense than playing Cole behind Crouch. I understand why he Didn't play Rooney,i think we all want to see him play but we can't risk his foot this early in the tournament and we all know it. I would have liked to see Walcott on if Owen absolutely had to come off which i don't think he did,the youngster could be another of our tournament surprises of which we've had a fair few over the years including Owen,Beckham and Rooney... Let's just wait and see... Come on England...
__label__1 , How do you not be ashamed of  Jesus Christ? (I'm in high school and it's hard around my peers)?,I know the verse that says if you reject him before men he will reject you before his father in heaven and I dont want to make that mistake.\n\n(I only want answers from fellow followers of Christ),It is not easy to start out with, but the more you stand for Jesus the easier it becomes.  You may want to just not say anything to start with, but with time, you will find that you will not be able to keep from saying something.  And most of all put yourself in Jesus' hands and He will put the words in your mouth.  Always depend on Jesus or you will foul up every time.  First you have to pray for the person, that the Holy Spirit will work to open that persons heart to what you share with them.  That's all that you can do.  From there the Holy Spirit will point that person to Jesus Christ.  We must realize that we ourselves can't save anyone, we just plant the seed.  You may never know if what you shared has any effect on that person, but just knowing that what you did was right thing will make you want to share with someone else.  The greatest feeling you will ever have is seeing someone come to Christ and realizing you planted the seed.  Knowing in your heart that this person will not spend eternity in hell.  If you would happen to see this shared testimony through and see the other person saved, don't get filled with pride.  Remember pride comes before a fall.  And also remember when you do share, don't talk down to them, be humble and just state whatever you feel that Jesus is leading you to say.  Don't get mad and lose you temper if they reject what you say, just knowing that you tried is what matters.

Are you a man or women and know men in your circle who have been so abused? Please share your stories with researcher into domestic abuse of men.,I think MEN don't speak out because they feel like they will be made fun of.  I think that no one has the right to abuse anyone.  I am a woman and my father always told me to respect men and never ever push, shove or slap a man.. A man is no diffrent than a woman when it comes to domestic violence.

Obviously neither of their flags includes such colors. So whats the deal then? They both have horrendous kits by the way. Ughh\n\nWell I did some research:\n\nAustrailia:\nGreen and gold are the national colours of Australia, as proclaimed by Sir Ninian Stephen, the Governor General of Australia on 19 April 1984. The exact colours were specified as being Pantone Matching System numbers 116C and 348C. Green and gold are also the traditional team colours of Australian national sporting teams. Nearly every current Australian national sports teams wears The Green and Gold, although the hues and proportions of the two colours may vary between teams and across eras. It is widely believed that the colours were chosen because they are the dominant colours of Australia's floral emblem, the Golden Wattle.\nSource:  http://wikipedia.com\n\nHolland/Netherlands: Why orange?\n\nBecause it's the national color of The Netherlands, and de Heers are Dutch!\n\nFacts About Orange in The Netherlands\nThe family name of the Dutch Royal family is van Oranje Nassau, where Oranje is Dutch for orange. They are also referred to as The House of Orange, just as the royals in England are referred to as The House of Windsor. \nDuring Dutch holidays, one often sees orange banners hanging alongside the red, white, and blue Dutch flag in recognition of The House of Orange. \nThe national Dutch soccer team wears orange jerseys. \nSource: http://deheer.com/orange.html\n\nHope this helps...and gets me best answer!! :-P

Is this ok or do I need to pay estimates taxes as I go along?,No you don't have to pay through out the year.  You can pay when you file by 2007, but be aware if you don't have all the money to pay by April 15, penalty and fines will still accumulate even if you file an extension. So be ready to PAY! And yes it will hurt. So don't be surprised. That's why a lot of people have the maximum taken out so they don't owe.

__label__9 , College Relationships?,I'm going to a 4 year college(in August) 3 hours drive away from home.  I've been dating my boyfriend for 4 years, and we both really want to make this last.  What are some tips to keep connected?  I will probably be able ot visit him every other weekend or so.\nSo far, the plan is to get webcams.  What else?,I have a very similar situation happening to me in August as well, only i am not as fortunate because my girlfriend is moving across the country, whereby i will not be able to see her nearly as often. My plan consists of keeping the romance alive.  I will never bring up any issues, and i will never allow myself or her to go to bed upset/mad. (these are in case there are any problems.)  Other things i will do is to visit her as often as i can, talk to her on the phone whenever her schedule will allow me to (i will make time and sacrifice my own schedule just to talk to her) even if it is only to say hello, i love you, goodbye. I will e-mail her, and send her e-cards, poems that i have written, just little reminders that i love and am thinking of her.  I will send her letters randomly, so that she never knows when to expect the next one (allows for some surprise), and i will randomly send gifts and flowers for no reason at all.  Sometimes, i will just show up without telling her (surprise again).  I have a good many other ideas that i could share, if you would like, but i will leave you with my most important idea to keep it alive: I will trust her completely.  I will never allow myself to become jealous or untrusting because she really does not need that; college will be stressful enough without me adding to that burden.  I will let her grow as a person, adapt to her, and be her backbone in all decisions which she chooses; i will support her and be there for her. This i believe is truly important.  Good luck to you, and I hope that things work out for you!

__label__2 , What is the formula for figuring out how many watts an appliance useses?,I know it has something to do with the voltage and the amps but not sure the set up of the equation.,The first part of the formula is knowing how many watts the appliance uses. The old standard light bulb is the easiest to find out. Just look on the top of the incandescent bulb and it will say: 60, 75 or 100 watts. With appliances you may have to do an extra step. On the back or bottom of the appliance will be a label or plate with data on it. If the watts used are not shown, find how many Amps the appliance uses. Once you know the Amps you can calculate the watts used.\n\nThe formula for finding out how many watts that are being used is: Amps multiply Volts equals Watts

__label__1 , What age do you think children should be able to stay home alone?,What age should they no longer have a babysitter?  Example:coming home from school and spending 3-5 hours alone.,It depends on the child, and your exact situation; but a safe bet would be a young teenager, 13-16. An extremely responsible child in a neighborhood with very little crime, I might say as young as 10. Then again, I know some kids who aren't responsible enough to be alone before they turn 14; and some neighborhoods I've lived in where I wouldn't let the best kid stay even then. My best advice is if you trust them to fix a healthy meal for themselves (especially since they'll be alone until between 6 & 9 PM) then you can probably trust them to be alone.

Honey is also sticky, not slippery, so it would be counterproductive in other ways.

I know it is natural to argue but when they fight, they get me imvolved. My parents yell at me for things I didn't do and for things I do that weren;t bad at all. I get grounded often. I get in trouble for speaking. If they have a bad day, they make mine worse. They threaten me, sometimes. And lately they have being hurting me a bit. Not much, but just enough that you wish you could just kill yourself. For example, my mom burned me with the iron curler, she knocked me off the stairs, my dad 'accidently' he smashed the door into my face when he opened it. They claim it is just accidents but . . . I don't believe them. I am afraid, and I don't want to call the cops. No one know but you people who read this. I am going to be moving to a hotel to live by myself when I go to high school, so should I just wait until then and leave things the way they are?,That is a real tough question to answer from outside.\nI think you know that it is not OK for anyone, including your parents, to physically abuse. Spankings and swats are one thing, but it sounds as though you're into something closer to abusive behaviorisms.\nAre they accidents? You should be able to tell by their reactions to these incidents. \nKnow this. Whatever the answer to that, you are worth more than the way you are feeling. I considered suicide many times as a youngster, but God has a plan. \nIs there anyone who could take you in for a while. It sounds like maybe you're just getting caught up in your parent's battle and they aren't necessarily disappointed in you in any way. Still, it is not an easy environment to be in and always has the possibility of danger. \n\nKeep your head up best you can. Pray to the Lord for some resolve...some kind of answer. Use your God-given judgement if it gets too intense. My prayers are with you.

Our hearts lead us instead of our jock straps (generally speaking of course.)  But when you get a woman mad, WATCH OUT!  How does the saying go? Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned...or something like that.\n\nI think at first the rest of the world will laugh.  Well, parts of it anyway.  I think most, if not all, of the European countries will become friendly again, including France.  I think she would be able to reason better with some of our enemies.  But she would be completely disrespected by the Muslim ruled countries.  And possibly even several of the Asian countries.  Basically places that look at women as secondary citizens, if they even consider women citizens in the first place.\n\nI believe children's rights will be protected better.  As well as women's rights.  While I would personally never have an abortion, she would fight to keep Rowe v. Wade intact.\n\nI know, that was more than 2, I just couldn't help myself.  I could keep going, but want you to actually read my answer.  There are some women whose names have been mentioned for the Presidency who I would vote for in a second.  And there are others who scare the crap out of me.
__label__1 , Original sin... If we are guilty by relation, what is God's penance for creating evil?,If I can be held responsible for my 6000 year ago ancestor, shouldn't God have birth pains for creating Satan and every other evil?,He didn't create evil, evil is a consequence of separating from Him (which is what Lucifer - one of His created beings chose to do).  Evil is the anti-God state.  Not His creation, but the lack of Himself.\n\n\nI don't believe we are guilty by relation.  We become guilty when we make a choice to sin.\n\nI think those who believe in original sin, from what I understand, have misinterpreted David in Psalm 51:5  Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,  and in sin my mother conceived me.\n\nI think that means that David was conceived and born into a world where sin exists and is pervasive.\n\nIt also could be from Exodus 20:5-6  you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.\n\nI take that to mean that children suffer consequences of the decisions/sinfulness of their ancestors.  Think of the generational effects of alcoholism or incest.  Those sins are visited upon their children.  It's not that those children are guilty of the sins of their fathers, but they suffer the effects of the lives their parents have lived.  (Please note that I do not believe that any time a child suffers it is because of something a parent did.  We all suffer because of sin and it's influence and effect on the world.)\n\nI don't believe that God holds us responsible for what our ancestors did.  He offers us a way out of the bondage of our ancestry.  We leave the ways and dysfunctions of our earthy fathers and take Him as our Father, so that we may learn mercy, forgiveness, love, longsuffering, truth, honor, reverence, goodness, kindness, faith, joy, gentleness, and self-control.  Notice I say LEARN these things.  Depending on our baggage and our level of ability, these things take time.  And practice.  You'll never hear me say that Christians are sinless, or better than anyone else.  We've just accepted the offer of salvation and are becoming Christ-like.  It's a process.\n\nBecause of Jesus we have freedom from the cycle of dysfunction and abuse that our fathers visit upon us.  He doesn't hold us responsible for their actions, but offers us a means of escaping repeating them.\n\n(What makes you think that Angels don't have a soul? Clearly they have free will, otherwise Satan could not have rebelled against God.  See Revelation 12:9 and surrounding.)

Plus, the boy's love life sucked..first Willow, then Buffy and when he finally finds Anya; she gets killed....I really felt for him.\n\nGiles - The father figure. No matter how he tried to hold himself aside from the group emotionally, he could never keep his feelings at bay. No matter how digusted or disappointed he was with one of them, he still had their backs in a crisis.  The true father feelings that he developed for Buffy were wonderful.
__label__4 , What is the salary and wages for an international buyer?,It's for a project.,Are the Medellin cartell hiring? Cash up front. The `Family'aka Sicily, you need connections [alas], or the real legal stuff [as opposed to govt subsides aka above]. The CIA made heaps from the heroin trade in SE Asia, but I think they've switched to central Asia. They made heaps: how else to support the black ops of the Pentagon. Then there is the Russian Mafia, tricky, the Triads, invest with a finger or was that the Japanese? then there are the future markets, hedging, [dodging the tax dept], or go swiss and have your money laundered, dried, and probably ironed and no one will know how filthy rich you are. Or the Isle of Wight banks, you don't have to buy anything, they come to you! Or you can buy from me! I'm a transnational enterprize-publishing, low returns, or do it the Chinese way: what IP? There is a future there somewhere for you. Good luck, maybe we can form an `offshore company'! Your dodgy partner in business.......

__label__8 , Why do fools fall in love?,,Hi! The question should be, why do we fall in love and become fools? Actually, in my own opinion, it is not just fools who falls in love but everyone falls in love as well.. even the brightest man/woman became fools when love hit them. We don't and can't control it. It just happen. Sometimes, we do stupid things when we're in love. We follow our hearts than following our minds that is why we are like fools in the end.

__label__2 , about proximity switch?,,Proximity switches are used in industry to detect proximity of moving components. I am from aviation industry so I give example of landing gear down & locked condition sensing being done by proximity switches.The main parts of a proximity switch are the switch module & the target which do not come in contact with each other but come in close proximity. When the target comes in close proximity to the switch a signal is generated from the switch module for the appropriate circuit.\nThere are two distinct types of proximity switches;\nA) Magnetic type; Here the switch part of the module consists of an internal magnetically operated microswitch & the same is activated when a magnetic target comes in close proximity to it.\nB) Solid state type; The switch module consists of a gauss generating unit. When the non-magnetic target comes in close proximity to it the internal circuit is completed & a signal is generated.
__label__2 , general mechanism of action and routes of adminestration of Local Anaestheasia?,,There are several theories put forward by which a local anesthetic  agent works. The commonly accepted theory is the Specific Receptor Theory.. The local anesthetic agent binds to certain receptors on the cell membrane and exert their action.The sequence of action are as follows:\n * Displacement of calcium ions from nerve receptor site..\n * Binding of local anesthetic molecule to this receptor site..\n * Blockade of sodium channel.\n * Decrease in sodium conduction.\n * Depression of rate of electrical depolarization.\n * Failure to achieve threshold potential level.\n * Lack of development of propagated action potential.\n * Conduction blockade.\n  \n   As for as the routes are concerned, LA can be given as:\n * topical application.\n * infiltration under the skin or mucous membrane to block peripheral nerves.\n * intramuscular to block a nerve, e.g. mandibular nerve   block for extraction of lower molars.\n * intrathecal ( into the spinal cavity), e.g.as in cesarean section.
__label__2 , Is it true that the weather-man is only correct 13% of the time?,,The weather report doesn't tell you it is going to rain or snow, only that there is a likelyhood of that happening based on prior experience.  If you were going to role a die and someone told you there was a 50% chance of getting an even number, it doesn't make him wrong if you get an odd one.  Even if you get three odds in a row, he is still correct, it just didn't help you very much.  That is the limitation of a weather forecast.  It never says it is going to rain, but that rain is likely.

This can bring on  a yeast infection. Also, a home remedy that my friend swears by is a plain yogurt douche. My friend says that rubbing it on the irritated skin, soothes it too. She should wear loose clothing and cotton panties. Yeast infections can occur due to stress. Make sure she is not too stressed.

__label__2 , how tall is the leaning tower of pisa?,,Tower of Pisa\nThe tilting of the structure is not new. Soon after this 800-year-old campanile (free standing bell tower) was begun, workers noticed a risky inclination caused by soft subsoil. Partial remedies were applied and the architecturally flawed tower was completed about 70 years later.\nOver the centuries the tilt angle of the 56-meter (182-feet) tall Leaning Tower of Pisa continued to increase. Today the top edge lists about 5 meters (16 feet) from the perpendicular, creating a gravity-defying appearance.\nSome experts predict an any-year-now collapse, others believe that the current restoration project will save this world wonder.

Millions of people can't even drink alcohol for health reasons, their rights are being completely denied, so why should gays insist that people educate themselves about homosexuality, when many of them condemn people for using cannabis (pot) without ever educating themselves on the subject?...

__label__8 , what u think about the movie troy write a full review?,,The scenery of 'Troy' is pretty accurate . . . the costumes are pretty, and that's about as far as it goes.  The writers took A LOT of liberties with history simply in the fact that the 'bad guy' won.  That is, the Greeks sacked Troy, killed all the men, threw the babies from the walls and sent the women to various city-states as slaves.  Paris and Helen didn't escape in a tunnel.  No happy ending, but Hollywood seems to frequently ignore the facts.  They could have called it anything but 'Troy' and been more accurate.\n\nYes, I own the movie because Eric Bana & Brad Pitt look great in skirts.  Oh, and Sean Bean.  Yes.

__label__1 , Why would a God allow His followers to wage war between each other?,In the Middle East, the Jews fight the Muslims, the Muslims fight the Christians.  In Ireland the Catholics and Protestants wage war.  \n\nAll of these people have the SAME God, what's the problem?,First, the fighting in Ireland is not between Catholics and Protestants.  It is between people who want to remain part of Britian, and those who want independence.  The majority of those who want to remain part of England are members of the English church.  While those who want indepence are mre often cathlic (non-Church of England).  But the fightings is not religion based.  It is entirely political.\n\nAs to why fighting happens between people who claim to worship the same God, it happens for the same reason that any war does.  The people involved have difference they can not settle any other way.  Sometimes they actually are about religion.  Most often they are about land (who gets Israel) or power (who rules Ireland) or money (who get the oil).  Religion is simply a good motivator to get people into a fight that they might not do otherwise (They will kill to get rid of insert religion fanatics before they will kill to get oil)\n\nWhy does God permit it?  If you mean permit as in support or encourage it, he doesn't.  War between his people is a sin, and those who deliberate stir up should fights will be punished for it in the end.\n\nIf you mean permit, as in why does he not stop it...I would ask you how?  If when Hitler and Nazis had first started their march on Europe, God had come through with a death angel and struck them all down, can you imagine that uproar there would have been against him?  Many would have been calling God evil and murderous for slaughtering thousands of innocents.  Look at all the charges leveled against God for his actions against Pharoah in the days of Moses, with the ten plagues.  All intended to stop the murder, enslavement and abuse of nearly 3 million people.  But seen by many as an evil act.\n\nGod has stopped wars in the past.  He has used plagues to take down armies.  He has used natural disasters to wipe out evil nations.  He has used revolts and riots to take out unjust rulers and governments.  He has used armies to stop evil and aggression.  He can and will use whatever force is needed.\n\nBut he most often uses the power of love, help, support, giving, and good to change lives rather then destroy them.  To bring peace, not war.  That is the only way that will work.

__label__7 , Is the financial investment worth the risk?,I have an idea for a product and have gone to Davidson Inc. with my idea and they have sent me a contract outlining what they will do with my idea.  They will research it, find companies who may license it, then put together a portifolio, and let me decide if I want them to create a prototype for actual presentation. The catch is, it's about $700 for the research and portfolio, then potentially up to 15K for creation of a prototype with which to take to companies for them to consider. I think my idea is a good one, I know of nothing like it on the market, and I believe in it's marketability. (esp. compared to some of the crap out there in stores) What I want to know is if any one has experience with this company, and feedback. Does anyone know of the cheapest way to promote an idea or product. I can't make one. I could draw a picture with a written description. I was advised to not get a patent right away, as the product itself may require revision.,Unless you have the knowledge or resources to make a prototype yourself, your going to need a company to help you. However like the previous poster said if they are the ones that advised you not to get a patent then i'd be very wary. There are reputable companies that do deal in this but I couldn't tell you who. You could go with the private investors but again unless you can make it, or know someone who can what good will that money do?
__label__10 , what happens when a senator cannot complete a term?,,Actually, The governor appoints a new senator. He/She needs no approval from the State Legislature. The only thing is that if it is over a year from the next election for that seat, a special election must be held. But if it is less than a year they may serve out the rest of the term. In 2005, New Jersey senator Jon Corzine was elected governor. He was sworn in in January and he had the privilege of picking his own successor for that seat, Rep. Rob Menendez. Since the next election for that seat in in November, there will be no special election

Have you ever heard of a little thing called Pearl Harbor? Or how about this lil saying??? It's not the size of the dog in the fight,but the size of the fight in the dog. if we upset too many countries and they team up against us then what might happen? We might not seem so powerful then in comparison...

__label__2 , I have a question for a material or chemical engineer?,I have a small warm pack for massages that is clear plastic with a clear fluid inside.  There is a metal disc inside that you flex back and forth to activate the heat.  This makes the clear liquid turn opaque and warms up.  To reactive, you boil the warm pack for 5 minutes until the inside fluid turns clear.\nWhat fluid is contained in this?  What does the flexing of the metal disc do?\n\nThanks in advance!,Your heat pack probably contains Sodium Acetate.\n\nFlexing a metal trigger within the sealed container causes a few molecules of liquid to crystallize.  These few molecule start a whole chain reaction which starts a chain reaction causing the supercooled solution to change from a liquid to a solid as crystals form.\n\nThis phase change causes the pack to give out heat. When the heat pack contents crystallize, its temperature returns its freezing point, and then you can recycle it by boiling. \n\nWhen they pack is boiled, the crystals dissolve in their own water of crystallization so the heat pack returns back to a liquid state.\n\nI hope this was helpful!

__label__10 , What Is the Diference Between Leagal Immigrants and Those Who Would be Illegal?,I mean, why can some come and others can't.,Legal immigrants are people who enter the country lawfully by obtaining a visa (immigrant and non-immigrant) from the American Embassy.\nThey usually go through background checks, criminal checks and have to provide medical records to be allowed to get the visa. They also have to wait for their priority date (each country has different priority dates). \nOnce they enter the U.S. they go to a Custom and Border Protection Offficer/Agent to be inspected before they are allowed into the U.S.\n\nIllegal Aliens bypass these checks by entering the country without inspection and any kind of checks.  Usually by crossing the border through Mexico or Canada.

__label__5 , does anyone know how to fix the brightness on a acer laptop?,hey i just got this new acer laptop, and i lowered the brightness to check it out, but now it doesnt wannna go up, no matter how many times i have tried. does anyoneknow how to make it stay bright? it will help me a lot. thanks in advanced,If it's new or under some kind of warranty, I would try calling tech support if there still is one for Acer. I have seen this once or twice with IBM laptops in the somewhat distant past and the problem is likely in the switch that raises and lowers the brightness. We sent them off for repair. If this is a known issue with Acer, then they may likely repair it free even if it's out of warranty though you would have to pay shippng it there (and get insurance) to the repair center. Hopefully, it isn't he LCD that has gone bad - that can be expensive on a laptop. Also, you might look closely at the keyboard for an Fn (purple lettering maybe) key which will correspond to other purple writing above some of the function keys. There will be one that has some type of sun or light on it that will adjust brightness or dimness, you might tinker with these holding down the Fn key as you repeatedly press the corresponding key. This may be how you dimmed it though - just a thought. Good Luck!

I am what did was wrong and they caught me with the stuff, but what does pleading no contest  mean, i heard it is not saying your are guilty or not, but it just says that you except what ever charges are being filed against you, you i plead guilty or no contest. i heard no contest has better benefits, what benefits are those.,We love paying extra for all of our items to cover the shops losses due to parasites like you. How about you develop a conscience and do the right thing.

You never know, acting with integrity here could be the start of a whole new life for you.

After staring for a few minutes, i began to feel choked up, then i began to tear up. I only just noticed this as being strange behavior. \n\nWhat I'm thinking is that it may have triggered a sad memory from the past without me realizing it. The only thing is I can't think of why anything that I saw or heard would make me cry (except for that the song was about death but I've heard the song before).\n\n\nAny ideas?,You subconsciously may have been thinking of how fast you've grown up,noticing the age difference between the two pictures.

__label__2 , find the equation of the line parallel to 2y-14=0 and passing through (0,3/4).?,,2 lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal.  To get the slope of the line 2y - 14 = 0, get its slope-intercept form:\n2y - 14 = 0\n2y = 14\ny = 7\n\nClearly, the slope is 0.\n\nSince you know the slope, m = 0, and it passes through (0,3/4), use the point-slope form of the equation of the line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\ny - 3/4 = 0(x - 0)\ny - 3/4 = 0\ny = 3/4 (slope-intercept form)\nor\n4y = 3 (standard form)\nor\n4y - 3 = 0 (general form)\n\nNote:\nThe point-slope form was derived from:\n\nm = rise/run\nm = change in y/change in x\nm = (y - y1)/(x - x1)\nm(x - x1) = y - y1\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nHope you like this ^_^
__label__2 , I'm looking to purchase a telescope for my family. What's the best telescope for the money? GoTo is mandatory.,My children are small, so I want to be able to find celestial objects quickly (hence GoTo is mandatory). \n\nI don't need to view terrestial objects. I do want great clarity and be able to see at least major bodies (Jupiter, Saturn's rings, Moon, etc.) in our solar system.\n\nMy budget is under $200.\n\nI've looked at these two: \nMeade's Jupiter DS114-EC #40114RE\nhttp://www.meade4m.com/4mshop/40114RE.html\n\nJupiter DS114AT-RE #40114AT-RE\nhttp://www.meade4m.com/4mshop/40114ATRE.html\n\nThank you for your answers in advance!,Either one is just fine but if you're only going to be looking at the moon and solar system objects (e.i. the planets), you probably don't need the Go To feature. Everything in the solar system is bright and easy to find.. The Go To is only needed for finding dim objects. I would consider giving up the Go To for  better optics. The eye pieces with these scopes are small. Standard eyepieces are 1 1/4 inch these are .96  so they'll be tougher to look through. Do you have a college/science center that has an astronomy club ?? They could be the best source for help.

We are in different  countries?,Well I think he is still in love with me because when we talk by phone he says that he miss me and by email he writes thinks like: Love, miss you. But sometimes he doesn´t write for a while, and when we talk again he tells me that he had been very busy at work (doctor, that is why i belive him). But sometimes I feel like I should forget about him and move with my life.,How can he be your ex if you two are still in love with each other?  If he really loves you there will be no excuse for being busy.  If he really wants to talk to you even if he is busy he will talk to you anyway.  I think you better make sure if he really loves you, baby.  You see, my husband has been working in a different country for quite a long time now but in 9 years that we've been together, believe it or not, he calls me every single day.  Not only that, in a single day he calls me not less than 3 times a day just to check if I have already eaten and many small thoughts that really counts.  He also e-mail me.  No matter how busy a guy is, if he really loves you he will not think twice in talking to you whenever there is time and he doesn't mind spending his money just to call overseas.
__label__3 , What is burn scar carcinoma?,I had a third degree burn on my left knee as a child.The Dr told me there is a possibility there is a burn carcinoma now. What is this? I know carcinoma is cancer but I had never heard of this before.,SUMMARY.  Marjolin's ulcer is defined as a malignant, ulcerating neoplasm occurring in cicatricial tissue, and is thought to be more aggressive than the other more common varieties of skin cancers. It has been reported in chronic scars of diverse origins. The following report describes two cases of burn scar carcinoma. A review is made of the literature pertaining to the mechanisms, paihological findings, clinical presentation, prognosis, prevention and treatment of this malignant degeneration of burn scars.\n\nIntroduction\nThe association between thermal burn scars and neoplasia was initially recognized by Celsus in AD 100 (Treves and Pack, 1930). Jean Nicolas Marjolin, writing in 1828, is widely credited with the first description of tumour arising in bum scars (Marjolin, 1828). It was De Costa in 1903 who first coined the term Marjolins's ulcer, applying it to tumours arising in simple leg ulcers. Although Steffen (1984) and Nancarrow (1983) have pointed out that Marjolin probably did not recognize the malignant nature of these ulcers, most other authors have all iden'tified the malignancy found in burn scars such as Marjolin's ulcer. Today the term Marjolin's ulcer is used to describe malignant turnours arising in many different types of cutaneous scars and chronic wounds, such as bum scars, chronic venous ulcers, pressure ulcers (decubitus ulcers), osteomyelitis sinuses, urinary fistulas, pilonidal sinuses, gummata, smallpox vaccination scars and radiation scars (Abbas and Beecham, 1988; Barr and Menard, 1983; Berkwits et al., 1986; Fishman and Parker, 1991; Nancarrow, 1983; Steffen, 1984). Butterworths Medical Dictionary (MacNalty, 1965) now defines Marjolin's ulcer as any cancer arising in association with a chronic sinus, ulcer or scar.

__label__5 , How do I have an ASP page return it's own name?,Let's say I have a page called mypage.asp.  I want to insert the filename of the page into a string variable.  Right now, I'm just hardcoding on every page [strName=mypage.asp].  Is there a way to have the page grab it off its own filename?,Using VB Script you can grab the file path, which returns the full file path of the current page (e.g. /somedirectory/somefile.asp). Once you have this, you'll need to split the value using the forward slashes. This will create a one dimensional array. Just grab the last item in the array and you have your file name. Below is a VB Script example:\n\n<SCRIPT Language=VBScript RUNAT=SERVER>\nFunction getFileName()\nDim lsPath, arPath\n\nlsPath = Request.ServerVariables(SCRIPT_NAME)\n\narPath = Split(lsPath, /)\n\nGetFileName =arPath(UBound(arPath,1))\nEnd Function\n<SCRIPT>

Once again, proving that hatred & stupidity is alive and well here in our World. Love is such an easy concept & idea and so difficult for many to accept.,Why the haters are here: Fortunately, the LGBIT community is big enough to get their own Q&A section here.

__label__3 , is there any food or tablet that contains ALL the essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids?,...for example is it possible to live on just spirallina and chlorella?,Nope. The reason is - we haven't yet discovered ALL the essential nutrients yet. Let's take carotenoids, for example. Science has found hundreds of new ones in just the last couple years and continues to find new ones regularly. Our bodies are extremely complex systems which have evolved to eat a variety of foods from nature.\n\nThe best thing you can do to ensure you get what your body needs to be healthy is to eat a wide range of real foods. Brightly colored fruits and vegetables are always good choices - color generally equals nutrients (with a few exceptions like cauliflower - no color but lots of vitamins and minerals).\n\nAlso, you missed on thing - essential fatty acids. Your body can't live or produce new cells without Omega-3 and Omega-6 fats.

The room begins to whirl around.  After the room reaches a constant speed, the floor drops down, but she doesn't fall.  Identify three forces acting on her and give the direction of each. \n\n2.  A book is sitting on the dashboard of a car that is stopped at a traffic light.  As the car starts to move forard, the book slides backward off the dashboard. Use the term interia to explain what happened. \n\n3.  Compare the effects of ravity and air resistance on a falling skydiver before and after she opens her parachute.,1. gravity is acting straight down, centrifugal force is acting towards the wall, and friction is holding her against the wall.  Obviously the centrifugal force and friction together are stronger than the gravity, or she would fall.\n\n2. The book was at rest -- an object tends to stay at rest unless acted on by an external force (that's inertia).  The book's mass (weight) gave it enough inertia to overcome the friction with the dashboard, so when the car moved the book didn't move with it, but tried to stay where it was.\n\n3. the surface area of the skydiver before opening the parachute doesn't offer much air resistance, so the skydiver is mostly being acted on by gravity and reaches terminal velocity fairly quickly.  Once the parachute is opened, the surface area of the skydiver/parachute combination is many times greater than it was, greatly increasing air resistance -- which slows the acceleration due to gravity enough to allow the skydiver to make a soft landing.\n\n:)
__label__3 , Why do they make condems that have flavors?,Why do they have condems that have flavors? do they suck on them or something?,How old are you? Well, you're asking. If a woman wants to preform oral sex on a man it makes it a little more pleasant than without it, safer also but, condoms, break and tear as well as come off. So, they are not 100% safe. No form of birth control or safe sex is 100%. They all faio from 6-15% and that's a big chance. I knowI wouldn\nt take it. I'd need a clean bill of health for 6 mos. then another one for 6 mos. then, just maybe, if I knew he was around me and no one else during that time.I'm just too scared to be used and themn die or be sick for one night of fun. doesn't seem worth it to me.

__label__3 , What could this breathing problem be?,Every now and then I start yawning again and again, and I can't stop.  I feel like I need more oxygen to stop yawning, so I breath much faster than usual.  Sometimes when I'm breathing faster I feel like I'm getting enough air, and sometimes I don't.  This happened to me today,and after a while I got lightheaded, and my vision got cloudy, but then suddenly it stopped, and I could breath normally again.  This happens every now and then but I don't usually feel light headed, and it always stops suddenly.  What could it be?,You are hyperventilating, Dude.  When you start feeling that way, breathe into a paperbag for a few minutes and it will help you.  Godloveya.

__label__1 , why are americans so happy to be so ignorent?,,Well you know what they say - Ignorance is Bliss\nIf you don't know any better or believe everything the government is telling you then life seems a lot easier to handle.  It is when you start to question why things are the way they are, life gets much more complicated.\n\nThis is why religion is so popular, because you do not have to think for yourself, everything is absolute and anyone who says different is just wrong.  Americans especially fall into this kind of conformity so they do not have to think to much.  Let the church or the government do the thinking for you.\n\nI know there is a lot more to this then that, but it is a good place to start.  Please do not think that all Americans are ignorant even if the majority seem to be.

__label__5 , what's the role of a average internet user, to fight against global spam?,it's boring to delete mails every day. what can everyone do for its own and in the interest of all users?,There are about 1.5 billion emails being sent around the around EVERYday. 70% of them are spam mails. The only thing we can do is try to ignore them and report them as spam mail. The problem with spam mail is that people just delete them, they dont report them. Everytime you get a spam mail, you can report it so that your ISP or Firewall or Security Suite can find out how they can block those mails. The more spam mail you send them, the better they can filter them out. It is very difficult to try and block every spam mail existing out there, but I think if everyone shows effort to report them, then maybe theres a chance that they can improve the security to block them. There might be emails that you get that I dont get, but I might get them a few months later. If your email helps block future spam emails, then it will help so much....it would be like a domino effect. \n\nThats the role we need to play. We need to report them and act like spam patrols and help eliminate them once and for all. We shouldnt just ignore them and delete them....its easier to point and click than to report the problem. However, its not going to help us fight against global spam either.

__label__3 , I need Kick Boxing Cd's, which are the best???,,I was sentenced to 6 months in prison a year ago for stealing a car.  I had no idea how to fight.  I had 3 weeks from my sentencing to get my affairs in order.\n\nI used that time to get in shape.\n\nI knew that I would not master the art of Karate, kick boxing, self defense, boxing or street fighting.  I basically just needed to know enough to prevent myself from being raped.  And if I was raped, I needed to know enough to prevent myself from being raped a second time.\n\nI ordered Kick Boxing for Wimps.  I practiced everything that CD had to offer over the next 3 weeks.  Needless to say, no one bothered me.  Due to my celebrity status, it may have helped that I was sentenced to a juvenile prison instead of the Big Boys prison.\n\nNow I use my new Kick Boxing skills to fend off cops and other thieves while I'm stealing cars.

__label__2 , electrophoresis?,,Electrophoresis is the movement of an electrically charged substance under the influence of an electric field. This movement is due to the Lorentz force, which may be related to fundamental electrical properties of the body under study and the ambient electrical conditions by the equation given below. F is the Lorentz force, q is the charge carried by the body, E is the electric field [1]:\n\n. \nThe resulting electrophoretic migration is countered by forces of friction such that the rate of migration is constant in a constant and homogeneous electric field:\n\n \nWhere v is the velocity and f is the frictional coefficient.\n\n \nThe electrophoretic mobility μ is defined as followed.\n\n \nThe expression above applied only to ions at a concentration approaching 0 and in a non-conductive solvent. Polyionic molecules are surrounded by a cloud of counterions which alter the effective electric field applied on the ions to be separated. This render the previous expression a poor approximation of what really happens in an electrophoretic aparatus.\n\nThe mobility depends on both the particle properties (e.g., surface charge density and size) and solution properties (e.g., ionic strength, electric permittivity, and pH). For high ionic strengths, an approximate expression for the electrophoretic mobility is given by the Smoluchowski equation,\n\n, \nwhere ε is the dielectric constant of the liquid, ε0 is the permitivitty of free space, η is the viscosity of the liquid, and ζ is the zeta potential (i.e., surface potential) of the particle.

__label__3 , What effects would it have on my body if I were to go a week totally without food?,,Why Fast?\n\nWater fasting eliminates addictions, bad habits and unhealthy thought patterns. During the fast, the palate recovers its natural sensitivity to simple foods. Salt, sugar, fats and processed foods become naturally unattractive. Fasting is an ideal time to be introspective and honest with oneself. It is conducive to quiet observation of thought patterns and values.\nFree your body from disease or accumulated toxins.\n\nFasting is surgery without a knife. It allows nature and her healing power to take control of our being and do her cleansing and repair work. Fasting is a medical procedure, restoring homeostasis, strengthening the immune system and healing many illnesses\n\nFree your mind from unnecessary boundaries.\n\nFasting is also an ancient spiritual practice, withdrawing the energy from doing and transferring it into being in the moment. Fasting takes us to our truth, allows old wounds to heal, addictions to fade, and our ego to die to be reborn into our spirit.\n\nFasting brings the ultimate rest.\n\nFasting provides a framework in which change is effortless and comes from the deep self.\n\nWho can do it?\n\nFasting is beneficial to almost everybody with the exclusion of a few medical conditions.\nFasting may be practiced preventively to attain better health and longevity.\n\n\n Periodic fasting provides the rest for your digestive system. It allows your digestive system to recuperate from the rough treatment that you may have given it by overeating or eating the wrong foods or eating at the wrong time.\n\nIn addition fasting also provides an opportunity to eliminate many toxins from your body.\n Some people think that fasting is difficult. If you prepare yourself for fasting it is not difficult. Prepare yourself physically by taking enough food and also plenty of liquids the day before. Prepare yourself mentally by deciding the night before fasting: Tomorrow is fasting day, and I am not going to eat anything. If you take this mental determination prior to the fasting day, you will not be hungry during the fasting day. If you don’t make a prior determination, during the fasting day you will start to think “Maybe I should eat, and fast another day!” Decide before hand and you will be able to complete your fast..\n\nAll in all, fasting is one of the best practices for maintaining physical, mental and spiritual health. I highly recommend it.

At least god realizes what an immoral, murderous pig he is on this one.\n\nI Kings 16:34 Laying the foundation for a city using your firstborn child and using your youngest son to set up the gates.\n\nIsaiah 13:15-18 If God can find you, he will “thrust you through,” smash your children “to pieces” before your eyes, and rape your wife.\n\nJeremiah 11:22-23 God will kill the young men in war and starve their children to death.\n\nJeremiah 19:7-9 God will make parents eat their own children, and friends eat each other.\n\nLamentations 2:20-22 God gets angry and mercilessly torments and kills everyone, young and old.  He even causes women to eat their children.,Wow.  You are really taking Lev 26:30 out of context!!!\n\nYou're making it seem like God wants people to eat their own children.   \n\nRead the entire passage.  It's talking about famine being the result of disobedience against God.  \n\nThousands of years ago, if a famine struck, it was not uncommon for people to begin eating the flesh of those who had already died -- even their own family members.  \n\nWow.  Rarely have I seen someone so desperate to discredit and disparage religion, that they have taken a Bible verse so badly out of context.   \n\nHow utterly desperate you must be to prove your point, that you would resort to such an argument tactic.

I would advise you to go to the doctor and get checked out for physical problems - then if none are found, you should probably go to a psychiatrist for a consultation.  In addition, a full battery of psychological testing would be a good idea, if possible.  Check out the link below for the signs of depression - you have to have 4 or 5 most of the time, for at least 2 weeks, without a situational cause.

That is why you are warning her or him.\n\nKeep a close watch on them - as you are - but don't make a move until they get into the line of fire.\n\nYour friends will also have to learn who is truly sincere and who is a phony - so you can't always protect them - they need to learn this on their own - even if it hurts - because otherwise, they will make the same mistake over and over again.\n\nGood Luck And God bless you all.

Do you strive for something more? What's your story?,My friend and I have this conversation often. Sometimes you get the feeling like Is this all there is?  THere are days I am completely content and so thankful for all I have...a loving, caring husband, a beautiful 9 month old son that I adore, a wonderful family, and a job that I...well, Love is a strong word...LIKE! \nBut, then there are days I wonder what if???\nI think it is human nature to always wonder what else is out there. And if you had made different choices where would life have led you? Very deep huh? :)
__label__10 , on reservation?,is isa not politics?...can v b'leve on these doc.who r not quailify..how can v take risk for life,Nothing is bad or good in its own stead. It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it bad or good. In India reservation was and is used to please some people and get quick votes, be it SC&ST provisions in constitution which was original for 15 years or implementation of Mandal commission after years of lying in bag. There are many aspects of reservation. It is fact there are some strata of society who need support to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness.\n\nHowever there is opposition for reservation because the benefit of it are not going to actual people rather they are taken up by some people of these society who are already in up class are taking up these benefits whereas actual needy people are still at the same place. No one will object if a really needy get the benefit, You and all are furious since it is someone who is not needy who is reaping benefit.\n\nAs far as making economic condition as criteria is concerned, there is always good and bad of all thoughts. Good about this will be that this should be the correct way of deciding giving help however there are too many lacuna in this as getting certificate for economic background is very easy to get since no one file income tax return and there no proof of incomes for people other than salaried people so what will happen ultimately is again people who do not deserve the benefit will get it and needy will remain eluded with this.\nI agree that when it comes to job then what we need is competent people in jobs to provide proper service and let our country grow. It is wrong to say the people who need help to rise first time are not competent but what is required is that we bring them up and educate and train them so that they are competent enough to take up the challenges. Now if we talk about getting a doctor without enough skills. This is often repeated example but what we fail to understand that a person cannot be a doctor just by getting admission in medical college. S/he became doctor after passing out from the college. If we say that college examination system is such that they will pass person without knowledge then problem does not lie in reservation in admission but in examination system which required to be looked into. Having said that if education system is not good and it will allow person without skill to get the degree then what is guarantee that a person who has come by other route let us by paying higher fees or something and for that matter what is guarantee that a person who have scored 90+ marks is good in medical study. So then we are running risk of many doctors without skills operating on us. So this argument that if the person has come with reservation will be not competent doctor is not correct. If a person has passed MBBS (s/he can be anyone reserve one or other) and do not know how to use scalpel and then we should hung all the teachers who have taught them, people who have set the papers and all the examiners who has taken their practical exams and checker who checked their examination papers.\n\nSo mantra for anything to be good and successful is honest implementation of the same.
__label__2 , what is the difference between chemistry and chemical engineering?,,Chemical engineering is the application of science, in particular chemistry, physics and mathematics, to the process of converting raw materials or chemicals into more useful or valuable forms.\n\nChemistry (derived from alchemy) is the science of matter at or near the atomic scale. In this pursuit chemistry deals with the properties of such matter, the transformations of matter and the interactions of matter with other matter and with energy. \n\nEXAMPLE: \n\nThe difference between chemical engineering and chemistry can be illustrated by considering the example of producing orange juice. A chemist working in the laboratory investigates and discovers a multitude of pathways to extract the juice of an orange. The simplest mechanism found is to cut the orange in half and squeeze the orange using a manual juicer. A more complicated approach found is to peel and then crush the orange and collect the juice. A company then commissions a chemical engineer to design a plant to manufacture several thousand tons of orange juice per year. The chemical engineer investigates all the available methods for making orange juice and evaluates them according to their economical viability. Even though the manual juicing method is simple, it is not economical to employ thousands of people to manually juice oranges. Thus another, cheaper method is used (possibly the 'peel and crush' technique). The easiest method of manufacture on a laboratory bench will not necessarily be the most economical method for a manufacturing plant.

__label__10 , When will the government start fighting terrorism and monitor everyone all of the time?,,As soon as we let them.\n\nWinston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.\n\nInside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.\n\nOutside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own. Down at streetlevel another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.

__label__10 , does the New York State budget law requires a balance budget, and Wy?,,What is meant by a balanced budget is subject to interpretation and handled differently in many states. See this chart from the National Conference of State Legislatures (which is an organization that serves state legislators across the country and compares how issues are handled differently by different states).\n\nhttp://www.ncsl.org/programs/fiscal/balbuda.htm\n\nNew York state's requirements are considered not stringent, the Governor is required to prepare a balanced budget but the legislature is not required to pass a balanced budget, and the State is permitted to carry an operating deficit across a fiscal year boundary. \n\nAlso note, even in states with more stringent requirements it is often unclear how a balanced budget amendment can really be enforced. And New York state politicians have been notorious for the last decade or so for passing budgets later than the deadline the state is supposed to meet.

__label__1 , what are phonetic symbols?,,Phonetic symbols are a set of universally accepted symbols used by linguists so that we know exactly how words are pronounced without knowing the spelling system of each language.  Each phonetic symbol represents only one sound and each sound has only one symbol.  They are written between brackets [  ].  Thus the English word read is written [rid] and meet is written [mit].  Anyone in the world who knows the phonetic alphabet would know how to pronounce these two words whether they know English or not.\n\nThe person who wrote phonemic is incorrect.  There is no phonemic alphabet.  Phonemes are based on an analysis of the phonetics of a language and are abstract symbols used to represent a class of sounds (allophones) that are related to each other by rule.  Phonemic transcription uses phonetic symbols (usually) written between vergules /  /, thus the phonemic representations of English read and meet are /rid/ and /mit/.

Galileo heard about the invention and made his own telescope in 1609. Though he was not the inventor of the telescope, I think he was the first to train it on various astronomical objects such as Jupiter, the Milky Way galaxy (which he could resolve to myriad stars) etc. He the the first to carry out astronomical observations using a telescope. He preached that the earth and the planets move around the sun, which was against the church viewpoints. For writing a book about the helio-centric theory, he was forced to recant his statement. Legend has it that after recanting, he is said to have muttered  epur si muove meaning  nevertheless it moves probably referring to the earth.

__label__7 , can a neighbour run his taxi and limo service from home - nightmare to live with!?,,Even if the business owner has a license to operate, that does not mean that the owner has gotten a zoning approval to run his business from home and park his limos on the street.\n\nZoning board typically takes a blind eye on home businesses -- UNTIL a neighbor complains. When a resident in the neighborhood complains of the traffic, inconveniences, too much comings-and-goings of vehicle  in a RESIDENTIAL neighborhood, the business owner will be asked (and in many cases, sued) by the county to stop operating the business in the community.\n\nI suggest you go to your county office zoning board. Check how your area is zoned, and if it is residential, then ask the procedure for filing a complaint. If the City/county officials find the business owner to be in violation of subdivision ordinances covering the amount of space required, and neighbors have complained about parking and traffic problems - they can close the business.\n\nNeighbors' complaints are always the litmus test in zoning. You can make it really difficult for them to operate their business, and I think you've got a good basis with their type of business.  \n\nHence, it is strongly recommended that home business entrepeneurs first check the zoning laws in the area to determine if the business is compliant. And be very nice to the neighbors! Otherwise, you can see your entire business hampered, if not closed, if zoning regulators get to you.

__label__10 , When will Republicans publicly apologize for electing George W. Bush?,,President Bush was quite successful actually at accomplishing many of the aims of his party:  1. passage of legislation necessitated by the events of September 11th that empowered his administration and future administrations to monitor the actions of its citizens more carefully than ever before (ie - Patriot Act), 2. firm support of many of the conservative ideals of the conservative side of his party - halting progress in stem cell research, support for instruction of intelligent design within schools, defense of marriage as an institution reserved for heterosexuals (by way of constitutional amendment!), etc, et cetera, et cetera.  3. Continued exploitation of foreign economies through legislation such as CAFTA, hypocritical stance on illegal immigration that ostensibly suggests that his administration is against it when, in reality, they couldn't be more for it - that which injects much cheap, productive labor into the economy, 4. That whole war on terror / war on oil debate isn't really a debate is it.  So long as the US is able to continue its penetration into new foreign markets, wrest control over other nations' resources, our economy may continue growing.  Like a sales ad, I'll stop right here and say that there's too much to list!  I have no doubt that Republican interests coincide with strong economic growth in this country, but I have always argued over the ethical cost of that growth.\n\nNo, they probably wouldn't apologize for a thing.  He was quite productive at realizing or perpetuating many of their ideals.\n\nI am neither a Republican or Democrat.

The mass (m) unit is in slugs.\n\nThere will be some error because one cannot form a perfect vacuum.  But the answer you get (m = W/g) will be close enough for most purposes.

__label__3 , What is best to eat before running a half marathon?,I've been running to lose weight and now find that I don't know what or how to eat before a long run.,Congrats on changing your lifestyle.\n\nLong runs  10K and longer can be very taxing on the body.  You should start to hydrate with lots of water 7-10 days before the run.  Watch your salt intake.

This is a little more accurate description of a radical extremist group who has no intention of ever accepting compromise on any of their evil agenda articles.

__label__10 , Is it illegal to record a phone conversation?,My friends mom called the other day becuase of me and my friends argument. Me and my friend already talked about and where fine again. but her mom called and it sorta made more turmoil and later on I found out that she recordied her and my moms phone conversation with out my mothers consent, that is illegal right? Its not like cops where involved and recording a rapist confess or something so I thought that its not legal and our parents had nothing to do with the argument and it was a stupid fight so why would she even record it?,The conversation can not be used as evidence in a court of law.  I don't know what the lady hoped to gain from recording the conversation other than to create more drama.  Some people are hooked on drama and they actually do what they can to create it.  Run as far away and as fast as you can from these types.  They will suck you dry.

They weren't arrested for praying. They were arrested for asking for seat belt extensions for no apparent reason and then not using them, as well as doing other suspicious things. Plus what you said about sitting in the 9/11 hijacker seat pattern, allowing them access to both entrances of the plane. They are hiding behind and using our civil rights laws against us. The imams were seeing how far they could push it before they got arrested so they could report back to whoever they're working for to plan for the future. At least this is what Michael Savage says. I don't agree with him on some issues but he seems to be right on about the threat from Muslim extremists.\n\nI haven't read all of it yet but here's an article about this if you're interested:\nhttp://washtimes.com/national/20061129-121812-1240r.htm

He says he likes me but I find it hard to believe.  He changes who he likes so often and I don't know why he would pick me over all the girls that like him.  I get really jealous whenever he talks about girls.  I feel that I'm not good enough for him.  I just don't understand why he would pick me and we like different things but I really do think that I like him.  We are total opposites.  He makes me feel happy and he's always there to hold me when I feel upset.  I have asked him if he's gay.  He denied it and hates when peopple say that.  I guess he's just really sensative.  If you call him gay then he will have a big fit and say that he's not.  I think that he's crys more than me.  I don't cry that much but I still get offended easily and so does he.  And he watches Will and Grace, not as much as he used to but he still does.  So is he gay or not?  Should I go for it and ask him out?,No, doesn't sound like he's gay, sounds like he's actually one of the nice guys! My bf watches Will and Grace cuz it's funny, he loves Karen, that doesn't make him gay cuz he watches it. A lot of guys are sensitive and he may really like you and if you are asking him if he's gay your putting a damper on his hopes with you! I would say go for it and ask him out, it sounds like you guys are already friends so why wouldn't he want to be with you? He is there for you and you guys make each other happy so ask him out!

Say that works out to be 100 for a particular molecule: that means that 100g of the substance contains 1 mole (6.022 x 10^23) molecules - so 1 gram contains one hundredth of that, or 6.022 x 10^21 molecules.\n\nApply that to each of the molecules in your questions, and you'll be home and dry.

The blood cells are sickle shaped..and cause severe pain, anemia, and because they are not carrying enough oxygen, weakness.\n\nThe disease can be tolerable with heavy morphine use by the person.  But, often the pain is so excruciating they get in a really bad sickle cell crisis.  The pain meds by mouth won't work.  So, they have to go in the hospital and get high doses of fluids in their bodies to keep the complications of necrotic joint disease from developing.  This is when it collects in the joints like your shoulder and causes very serious problems.  Also, pain meds in the veins and oxygen to help.  Some have to have blood transfusions.\n\nIt is really important to have a blood test before two blacks marry to rule out the sickle cell trait.

PHP classes or PHP functions?,I can take a reasonable guess not having looked at how it's implemented...\n\nOnce the object exists there will be almost no difference. Remember, a class is simply a collection of functions that have protected access to a group of variables. The only real drawback in OO languages is setting up this access for new objects, but these days it's hardly worth the mention. Inheritance, and the heirarchy lookup may, but it's extremely unlikely, make some slight difference.\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to store in variables what you need to store. Putting them in objects is simply more convenient in so many ways. You pay a tiny bit in performance for that, but you probably use less developer resources (if they count here).

__label__2 , how do you measure the dust level in the air?,,heres a basic information\n\n\nDUST can contain a particles of a wide range of sizes. The effect of these particles when ingested into the body depends on the size shape and chemical nature of the particles. There are standard definitions used for dust based on the particle sizes as follows:\n\nTotal Inhalable Dust: This is the fraction of airborne particles which enters the nose and mouth during normal breathing. It is made up of particles of 100 microns diameter and less. This dust fraction is required to be measured in many European jurisdictions.\n\nThoracic Dust: This is the fraction approximately 10 microns diameter and less. This is also referred to as the PM10 in the USA. This fraction will pass through the nose and throat, and reach into the lungs.\n\nRespirable Dust: This fraction is the particles approximately 5 microns and less. It certainly penetrates into the gas exchange region of the lungs, and is therefore the most hazardous particulate size. This fraction is required to be measured in many European jurisdictions.\n\nDUST IN THE WORKPLACE: For many nuisance type dusts the occupational limits are around 10mg/m3 for total dusts and 5 mg/m3 for respirable or PM10 dusts. These are normally measured with small air sampling pumps running for a number of hours, or a quick measure of relative dust levels can be obtained by using a light scattering dust meter.\n\nDUST IN THE ENVIRONMENT (or AMBIENT DUST): In outside areas the levels are usually much lower than in enclosed working areas, but the acceptable levels of dust before they become a nuisance are also set at lower levels than for workplace areas. Because ambient levels are lower they are more difficult to measure. If sampling pumps are used they need to be much larger and run for longer periods in order to collect a weighable amount of dust on the filter. Sometimes a measure of dust deposits on a surface is used to determine the amount of environmental dust.\n\nPERMITTED DUST LEVELS vary in different jurisdictions, and will be lower for hazardous materials.\n AIR SAMPLING PUMPS: These are simple vacuum pumps which draw air through a pre-weighed filter at a fixed flow rate for a known time. The pumps need for run for a number of hours to collect a weighable amount of dust. The filter is re-weighed to determine how much dust is present in a known volume of air. These filters will only collect a few milligrams or less of dust - a very sensitive and expensive balance is required. The filter holder needs to be specially selected to collect the particle size range required - e.g. PM10 or respirable. The filter holders are often only designed to operate at a pre-defined flow rate -if they are to collect the required particle size range. Personal pumps normally operate at about 2 litres/min. Ambient pumps operate at higher level - from 10 l/min - even up to 500 l/min.\n\nDUST DEPOSIT GAUGES: These are used in the UK to monitor Dust Deposits. The Directional Dust Deposit Gaugeto BS.1747 does give some indication of monthly deposit levels in four compass directions. Very inexpensive.\n\nRECORDING MICROBALANCE: Very sensitive device produced by Ruprecht & Pasternicht (USA). A vibrating rod with filter on top. Dust is collected on the filter. The change in the frequency of rod vibration is a measure of mass of dust on the filter. Instant recording. Expensive.\n\nLIGHT SCATTERING DUST METERS: The trouble with Air Sampling Pumps is that the dust level they measure can only be a mean value for a measurement over several hours. Light Scattering Meters measure the light scattered by dust particles and can give an instant dust level measurement. Great care is required in using these. The number on the meter should be calibrated against measurements with an air sampling pump for your dust since they really measure scattered light - and the amount of light scattered by a particle depends on many factors, such as particle size distribution, density, reflectivity etc. NOT a true grav

__label__1 , What are the origins of WICCA?,,2000 BC \n Babylon's Code of Hammurabi instructs, If a man has laid a charge of witchcraft and has not justified it, he upon whom the witchcraft is laid shall go to the holy river; he shall plunge into the holy river and if the holy river overcome him, he who accused him shall take to himself his house. \n \n3rd cent. AD \n Under the pre-Christian Roman Empire, punishment of burning alive was enacted by the State against witches who brought about another person's death through their enchantments. \n \n306 AD \n The Christian Council of Elvira (Canon 6) refuses last rites to those who had killed a man by a magical spell because such a crime could not be effected without idolatry (i.e. the help of the devil). \n \n313 \n Conversion of Emperor Constantine; Christianity is granted official toleration by the Roman Empire. \n \n314 \n Canon 24 of the Council of Ancyra imposes five years of penance upon those who consult magicians. Here, the offence lies in participation in paganism. \n \n785 \n The Council of Paderborn rules that sorcerers are to be reduced to serfdom and made over to the service of the Church. \n \n906 \n The document De ecclesiasticis disciplinis ascribed to Regino of Prüm describes popular notions of witchcraft and states it is the duty of priests to instruct the people that these things are absolutely untrue and that such imaginings are planted in the minds of misbelieving folk, not by a Divine spirit, but by the spirit of evil. \n \n1080 \n Pope Gregory VII writes a letter to King Harold of Denmark forbidding witches to be put to death upon presumption of their having caused storms, failure of crops or pestilence. \n \n1225 \n In Germany, the secular law code Sachsenspiegel designated death by fire as the proper punishment for witchcraft. \n \n1258 \n Pope Alexander IV instructs, The Inquisitors, deputed to investigate heresy, must not intrude into investigations of divination or sorcery without knowledge of manifest heresy involved. Manifest heresy is defined as: praying at the altars of idols, to offer sacrifices, to consult demons, to elicit responses from them... or associate themselves publicly with heretics. \n \n1275 \n The first witch is burned to death after judicial sentence of an inquisitor, in Toulouse, France. Her name was Hugues de Baniol and she confessed to having given birth to a monster after intercourse with an evil spirit and to having nourished it with babies' flesh which she procured in her nocturnal expeditions. \n \n1300-30 \n Beginning of the witch trials in Europe. \n \n1334 \n Large-scale witch trial in Toulouse, France, in which 63 persons were accused. Of these, eight were handed over to the state to be burned and the rest were imprisoned. \n \n1374 \n Pope Gregory XI declares that all magic is done with the aid of demons and thus is open to prosecution for heresy. \n \n1400 \n Peter de Gruyères, a secular judge, carries out large-scale witch trials in Bern, Switzerland. \n \n1435-50 \n Number of witch trails rises sharply. \n \n1484 \n Pope Innocent VIII publishes the bull Summis desiderantes affectibus (Desiring with the Greatest Ardor) condemning witchcraft as Satanism, the worst of all possible heresies. The bull also officially grants Heinrich Krämer and James Sprenger, Dominican inquisitors, the right to prosecute persons of any class or any form of crime. \n \n1486 \n Heinrich Krämer and Jacob Sprenger publish Malleus maleficarum (The Hammer of Witches), a learned but misogynistic book blaming witchcraft chiefly on women. It was reprinted many times thanks to the newly-invented printing press and was a major influence on the witch-hunt hysteria of the next two centuries. It was regarded as the standard handbook on witchcraft until well into the 18th century. \n \n1530s \n Prosecutions for witchcraft begin in Mexico. \n \n1532 \n T
__label__5 , how do i disengage the spam on my mail box? pls., explain conprehensively............?,,Wow.  That must be messy.  Since you didn't reference any specific software, one can only assume that you are referring to a physical mailbox and the commercial meat product Spam.  There are a few ways to disentangle Spam from your mail box, but I would not recommend trying to eat the Spam once you have!\n\n\n1.  Spam is a relatively soft product.  You should be able to cut it off fairly easily with a sharp knife.\n\n2.  A strong jet of water from a hose should clear off any reasonable amount of Spam, including any residue left over from option 1.\n\n3.  If your mailbox is metal and not mounted on something flammable, you can burn the Spam off.  Note that Spam does not burn through, but will form a protective charred shell.  Once it cools, you should be able to brush this off easily.\n\n4.  If none of these options work, you might want to try the impractical, but thoroughly amusing method of letting a dog or similar animal at it.  If you can find a dog that will eat Spam, your only concern is that they don't eat so much at once that the animal gets sick.\n\n5.  If none of this works, it might be time for a new mailbox.
__label__4 , Can someone tell me about Purdue University. Can someone with a GPA of 3.8 and?,ACT score of 22 get any form of scholarsip,It depends on what school you are applying to first of all.  Apply as early as you can.  When I was accepted I applied as early as I could and was notified of my acceptance within a month or two if I remember correctly (this was 5 years ago!).  I had a GPA of 3.2 and an ACT of 23 and I was accepted into the school of science.  That being said I went to a very prestigious boarding school and participated in a lot of extra curricular activities.\nAs for scholarships, contact someone at the school and ask them for help.  One of the things I loved most about Purdue is although it is a very large school, I knew all my counselors and professors and spoke with them often.  So you don't get lost in the crowd there!  They are very willing to help!\nhttp://www.purdue.edu/DFA/\nThat is the link for financial aid and scholarships at purdue\nAnd here is their number!  765-494-0998\nBest of luck, I LOVED going to Purdue!!
__label__10 , Immigration charges over $3000. to become a citizen. Do you think someone making 4 dollars an hr. can afford?,,You make a great point. Perhaps the only you've posted.\n\nThis does give people with money a leg up on becoming citizens and puts many of Hispanic descent at a disadvantage, because businesses here use them like the plantation owners used the slaves before the civil war.\n\nPerhaps the longer you're here waiting to become a citizen, the lower the price should be.\nThat way those who can't save...(don't tell someone making $4/hr could EVER save that much and live)...could earn a discount for amount of time as resident.
__label__4 , what does HTTp means on the internet?,,HTTP\n(HyperText Transfer Protocol) The Web's communication standard, referenced in the http:// that appears at the beginning of every web page address (an extra 's' on the end, as in https:// denotes the secure, encrypted form). Stabilized at HTTP/1.1, it defines the universal mechanism for exchanging application-level messages between Web devices. All web services run over HTTP.
__label__1 , What are the arguments for and against the existence of God?,,Do you know what it took to even ask the question? You have a physical machine called a body that is able to use its mind to ponder the question, relay visual information from a physical world of comparable low-tech computers through the optic nerve, into the brain, with the mind to comprehend the ramifications, then transfer that thought process to an incredibly complex systems of nerves, tendons, and touch to the fingers to type the letters. This then communicates a question of the soul. The soul is something that science cannot a.) explain and b.) create. It can only mimic with unsatisfactory results. That soul is concerned for the existence of an eternal destiny beyond time and space--that there is a world beyond the physical world we see in the here and now. You are an incredible creation who has been given the free will choice to believe, or not believe. A being that can love, write poetry, paint or play works of incredible complexity and beauty. To smell, and taste, enjoy. So, like you, I set out on a path to find my Creator. It is obvious that He exists, but is He personal or an impersonal force? My answer came through the study of prophecy in the Bible. Like the DNA strand and life itself, it was hard to dispute the evidence. Now with the realization of the truth of the Bible, God made it clear that He was not only a personal God, but One who wanted to know ME, and that He knew everything about me--even the number of every hair on my head.\n\nEphesians 3\nFor this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height-- to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

__label__1 , Help with gay marriage in new jersey?,I just recently moved to the uk from living in the states to marry my partner, we both now want to move back to the states and live together in new jersey where i lived my whole life. Can you please help with info or where i can get all the info we need to make the move to the states. We currently have a uk civil partnership. Thanks for you time...,As of now, there is no gay marriage in New Jersey. On October 25, 2006 New Jersey's Supreme Court ruled that homosexuals are entitled to the same rights as heterosexuals, but gave the state legislature 180 days to decide if those same rights would be in the form of a civil union or a marriage. Due to this ruling, New Jersey can either be like Massachusetts and recognize gay marriage or like Vermont and Connecticut and recognize civil unions. It is important to note that, even though a few states recognize either civil unions or marriage that those laws only apply to those individual states; there is NO RECOGNITION of either gay marriage or civil unions by the US Federal Government. \n\nMassachusetts is the only US state to recognize gay marriage. Vermont and Connecticut recognize civil unions. California has a domestic partnership law that provides most (but not all) spousal benefits to unmarried couples. Hawaii, Maine, and the District of Columbia have laws that provide partial benefits to unmarried couples.

__label__4 , Walden Question. Thoreau?,Why did Thoreau leave the woods. I don't think he left out of loneliness becuase he said that solitude was his friend. Also what does he hope to gain by living in the woods. My reaspn would be to completely simplify his life. Can you give me some addtional info?,Thoreau left the woods because he felt like he spent too much time lamenting the world's problems and not enough fixing them.\n\nBackground info:  Emerson was Thoureau's hero.  Emerson taught everything that Thoreau believed (mainly Transcendentalism and a mix b/w anarchy and true communism-not Chinese communism). However, Thoureau discovered that Emerson was a hipocrite- he didn't practice what he preached- and he (Thoreau) decided that he didn't want to be known as a hipocrite.  Unfortunately, Thoureau's circle of influence was much smaller than Emerson's, so he didn't do a whole lot to change the world. \n\nThoreou wanted to live in the woods because he wanted to live deliberately and simply. Here is a quote from his essay Where I Lived and What I Lived For :\n     I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.\n\nI hope this helped- I'm studying Thoreau right now too- so I'm not exactly an expert, you should try reading The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail- it will either make things clearer for you, or confuse you even more.

Japan (which we calculate to be worth $10B - 34% ownership of a $35B market cap as of 4/18/06, adjusted by a 15% discount to take into account the relative illiquidity of the asset.\n\nThere is a slight mismatch in the timing, but if you take $6.52 / $32.19 (YHOO closing price on 5/4), then we can conlude that 20% of Yahoo's value is derived from their share of Yahoo! Japan.
__label__2 , link to the electronic circuit design for control of oscillations in real life phenomena?,can neone provide a link to a circuit which controls oscillations of a pendulum or an oscillator in real life?for example in a mechanical swing.,Not to a pendulum but to control oscillations in a circuit sense, on ecould use a phase lock loop (pll).  Its whole life revolves around using a reference oscillator, locking onto it and outputting a new oscillation of frequency f or some multiplier of f.\nThe major components are as follows\n1) Phase Detector:  It determines if you are locked or not\n2) Charge pump: Produces an up or down control signal depending on the output of the Phase Detector to either speed up or down f\n3)Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO):  Takes the up/down control signal from the Charge Pump and produces a new f that is either faster or slower.  This is the output of your new oscillator.\n4)Feedback loop: Taken from the VCO, it is compared with the reference oscillator you started with and determines if the two are locked.  If they are, you have a locked pll and can know that the output from the VCO is a good clean clock.\n\nThis is a reeeeaaaallll basic overview.  Some pll designer will probably come in and correct me!

__label__5 , Which one do you think iis better, Yahoo or Google? Why?,I don't understand why people say that Google is better, aren't they the same thing? I'm talking about searching-wise.,Yahoo search is better from my side. Though i frequently use www.google.co.in, because of my firefox plugin(aggregate google and yahoo results), which aggregates the results to be obtained from google as well as yahoo in a single page. \nI do it because i need to get more search results to avoid the mistakes of missing relavant research content.\nYou can install this firefox extension to have the better search results in a single shot. http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/extensions/aggregate_yahoo_and_google/aggregate_yahoo_and_google-1.0+-fx+fl.xpi\nwhen ever i compare the results, some times its unbelievable that yahoo is more relevant to what we are thinking off. \nI mean for the keywords that are ambiguous, or related to more than one particular field, the first page results are always to the context in what we are searching for. For ex: if i type document as a search keyword in the context of knowing what a document is how it constitutes, its genreal structure, etc; google will get some irrelavent results in the first page itself, but the yahoo results are almost perfect to the context what i am searching for.\nI came to know that yahoo searching is based on artificial intellegence. You can browse to the site http://mindset.research.yahoo.com in which the search results are divided into ranges of academic and business interest and depending on the range selection results will differ.\n\nBut only problem with yahoo is its search interface is not so attractive as google is. and moreover google is faster than yahoo sometimes.

And love is hard work sometimes, its not just a pretty feeling inside.

First thing I do (with my cousin Brian hanging on the side) is jam them as hard and as far as I can go. Now the thing is JAMMING around the parking lot at full speed with no ability to stop.  My grandpa stood in front of me for a second with his hands out like he could magically make me stop. Totally hilarious.  My poor cousin Brian's knee was totally bouncing on the ground so he tore the heck out of his new courderoy pants and tore up his knee.

__label__4 , determinants of foreign private investment?,,Well, give it some thought.  Why would you consider investing in a foreign country?  You would only invest if you feel that:\n\n1. your money would be safe there, and\n2. you would earn a higher return by investing there than you would investing in your own country.\n\nPeople rarely invest as much where they feel the government is unstable or likely to take their assets away.

The first time, I didn't return to work until Wednesday but, honestly, I could've gone back sooner.  After the second eye, I went back on Tuesday.  \n\nKeep in mind that it isn't as if you won't be able to *see* right away... But you're going to want to rest the first day.  On the second and maybe third days, you could, in theory, be productive -- but there might be some pain and a lot of eye-watering (and some throbbing temples).  I had to wear protective eyewear, too, which would have looked really silly had returned to work right away. :-)\n\nBest of luck! The experience will be life changing!

For instance, you could get it to write to the console with a line like\nSystem.out.println(You pressed the button xx);\ndepending on which button was pressed.\n\nSecondly, you could create a seperate ActionListener and implement in the actionPerformed method checks to see which button was pressed.  Note, this would need to be a seperate class.  For instance\nclass FullActionListener // the action listener for all buttons\npublic void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n    String command = e.getActionCommand();\n    if (command.equals(9)) {\n        // do whatever you need to here for the button 9.\n        System.out.println(You pressed button 9);\n    } else if (command.equals(8)) {\n        // etc\n    }\n}\n\nThen,\nActionListener al = new FullActionListener();\n// the code on wikibooks\n        //creates all of the numbers that would be seen on a calculator\n        JButton button1 = new JButton(1);\n        button1.addActionListener(al);\n        panel.add(button1);\n        JButton button2 = new JButton(2);\n        button2.addActionListener(al);\n        panel.add(button2);\n etc...

I don't know your dad, but I imagine him as a loving father who wants the best for his princess. Maybe he sees something in that guy that you can't see because love makes your eyes seeing blurry. Your dad is a man who has seen many things through his life and knows what could happen to you if you are with some kind of guys. Remember, your dad is there to take care of you and guide you. He is not there just because he wants to find a way to make your life miserable.

Lewis because the Bengals haven't shown that they can stop the run all year.

__label__4 , should kids be able to keep thier cell phones with them during class at school?,,Only if the phones are off.  I can understand a parent wanting a child to have a cell phone with them.  However, it is very rude to have a phone on while they're in school.  It's distracting to the student, his/her peers, and the teacher.  Students are in school to learn, not to chat or text.  \n\nBtw, if there are students reading this, teachers know when you're texting in class.  It's quite obvious.
__label__2 , What effect does radiant energy have on the place it is striking?,,When radiant energy strikes a surface, two main things occur.\n\n1.  Some portion of the energy is reflected back.  This depends on the emissivity (e) of the material, which ranges from 0 (shiny surface) to 1 (very black surface).\n\n\n2.  Some of the energy is directly changed into heat energy as a direct result of the thermal radiation of the radiant energy.  Furthermore, the heat energy generated by the thermal radiation is distributed from the surface to the rest of the body by means of  heat conduction.

The government is the reason that we don't get ahead, too many politician competing with each other. Instead of looking for the welfare of their country. I feel ashamed of both parties, I do vote, but I vote for the candidate not for a Republican or Democrat. Even though that still doesn't help much. But the little I try to do, makes me feel better. Great question, hope you get a lot of different answers.

How long should an ex couple wait until they start hanging out again just as friends,Whether or not you two can be friends depends on many factors: how long you two dated, whether or not you were friends before or not, and how bad the break-up was. If you two think you can be friends, wait a few weeks and then do something casually in a group and see how it is. Just take things slowly, and you'll figure it out.

__label__8 , Joke.....with a moral...???,Once upon a time there was a nonconforming sparrow who decided not to fly south for the winter.\nHowever, soon the weather turned so cold that he reluctantly started to fly south. In a short time ice began to form on his wings and he fell to earth in a barnyard, almost frozen. \nA cow passed by and crapped on the little sparrow. The sparrow thought it was the end. But the manure warmed him and defrosted his wings. \n\nWarm and happy, able to breathe, he started to sing. Just then a large cat came by and, hearing the chirping, investigated the sounds. The cat cleared away the manure, found the chirping bird, and promptly ate him.\n\nThe Moral Of The Story\n1) Everyone who shits on you is not necessarily your enemy. \n2) Everyone who gets you out of the shit is not necessarily your friend.\n3) And if you're warm and happy in a pile of shit, keep your mouth shut.,Lmao and has the censoring changed a bit around here or what, coz I was able to say f***ing earlier and had to bleep it out myself. :)\n\nBloody hell did you see that, it happened again. :D

__label__1 , Do you think kids are getting more vulgar and disrespectful?,I remember when I was 8-18 I would never talk back to random adults. Also I would never use such foul language as I am hearing out of children these days. I was at the park playing basketball and a group of unsupervised 10 year olds came by and started using language worse than I have ever used in my life. When asking them to not use those words they told me to f@#k off. No respect i tell ya. What's the problem these days?,I totally agree. Children today can be rude and intimidating. I'm only 24, but things are really different now to when I was a kid.\nFor a start, there was no way that my parents would ever think of taking my side over a teacher's if I got into trouble - let alone consider taking the school to court!\nKids today think that there is no comeuppance for bad behaviour, and they're totally right. A teacher who defends themself against a child may well get arrested and fired for assault. A parent who smacks their child can end up in prison.\nAlso, loads of kids have absent parents, or parents who don't really give a damn about them providing that they're out of their hair. When you add this to the fact that millions of kids, boys in particular, grow up with no male role model whatsoever so have no idea what good behaviour should look like, it's easy to see why things are so horrible these days.\nI think that the issue is that people are always so quick to look to the schools or the government to solve their problems - in fact, most of these things could be solved by a bit of decent parenting, a little less bloody liberalism and a return to (mild) corporal punishment at home and at school.\n... I'll get off my soap box now!

She becomes independent in thought and financially too. \nIn today's scenario, the income of one may not be enough, so a mom working is the best solution. Moreover she guides her children through her open approach to various thing in life.\nA mom working also makes the kids self sufficient and independent. She is respected by people as she contributes a lot not only to her family, but also to the nation.

__label__4 , My daughter wants to become a dentist. I didnt go to college, how does she start this process?,we live in GA, no one in our family has been to college. She is 17 and taking college prep classes at her high school. The counselors there are not very helpful. What can we do to find out what direction to go?,Good for you, for wanting to help her with this process!  Too many parents would just stand back and hope she could find a way to do this.  There are several ways you can approach this.  If you have a family dentist with whom she has a good relationship, she (or you) could ask her/him for help with the process.  There are many websites, like www.collegeboard.com, which give information - she needs to prepare for the SAT, if she hasn't already taken that exam, and she should get help with her essays and financial aid applications.  Be careful, by the way, about rip-off companies which take your money and promise financial aid; I've seen too many people taken in by these sleazy people.  Once she gets accepted at a college, they should be able to work with her to get financial aid that she (and you) doesn't have to pay for up front.  The suggestion about community college counselors was a good one, and if you have any money, there are professional independent college counselors you can get advice from.  I can tell you that I'm a college professor, and many of us love it when high school students who are interested in our fields come to us for advice.  I don't know enough about the sciences, or I'd volunteer to help her myself!

__label__6 , What sports would you say it is easy and difficult to be a rookie in?,The sports that I would say it is easy to be a rookie in are basketball and football.\nThe sports that I would say it is difficult to be a rookie in are baseball, hockey, and soccer.,The easiest sport for a rookie is definitely the NFL. If you are on the teams roster even if you don't start you can make a big impact on a team. \n\nSome of the greatest NFL players started out on special teams and have used that to make a name for themselves. A virtually unknown rookie aka. Samkon Gado can become a good starter for an injured player.\n\nThe hardest place for a rookie would have to be in the MLB. Even if you make the 40 man roster it doesn't mean that you will play in a game. In baseball if you are a rookie and you screw up you get sent to the minors to refurbish your skills until they become ready to play in the majors.\n\nThe minors is a tough buisness for a baseball prospect. They get payed less than a teacher's salary and often don't get much playing time. \n\nBaseball is by far a tougher sport to get started in, but if you are good enough you could be making in the upper 100 millions. While in football it is easier to be a rookie, but when you make it big you would be lucky to get half that.

__label__2 , How does oxygen dissolve in water?,oxygen is a non polar molecule, o2, how would this dissolve in a polar solvent such as water. Dissolved oxygen is vital to life but how does it get there. what ion would the oxygen form to dissolve, O- or O2-?,Water, as a polar molecule, induces an accumulation of electron density (dipole moment) at one end of non-polar gas molecules such as oxygen (O2 ) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ). The electron cloud of O2 is normally distributed symmetrically between the bonded O2 atoms. When the negative end of the H2O molecule approaches the oxygen molecule, the electron cloud of the O2 moves away to reduce the negative-to-negative repulsion. A dipole (a molecule with positive and negative charges separated by a distance) results in the nonpolar O2 molecule and causes O2 and H2O to become weakly attracted to each other. This intermolecular attraction between the oppositely charged poles of nearby molecules is termed a dipole- dipole force. The creation of these forces explains the mechanism by which gases dissolve in water.

You'll get plenty of info.
__label__4 , What do you have to do to join a Fraternity/Sorority?,What are the traditions or rituals that sororities/fraternities do to induct new members? How will those organizations make the most out of my college experience? If you've been in one, that would be great. Thanks!,It varies from chapter to chapter, greek organization to greek organization, fraternity to sorority, etc.  Greek organizations no longer condone/allow hazing like one would think of, due to insurance rates and legal ramifications, among other things, I assume.  You will have to go through some sort of a pledgeship if you are joining a greek organization worth joining.  You may have to help clean the house, work on the homecoming float, DD for actives, go to formalized study hours, etc.  It is good stuff though.  You learn about your fraternities history; you get to know your pledge brothers, the actives, sorority girls, etc.  \n\nJoining a fraternity does so much for you in college, and even more for you beyond your college experience.  Fraternities provide a large brotherhood of people that care for you, guide you, support you and help you through your college years and beyond.  The Fraternity provides you with a group of people that are like you, that have the same goals as you, share the same struggles as you, have the same classes as you and want to be successful like you.  Whenever you surround yourself with people that share the same drive for success and goals as you do, it is much easier to succeed.  \n\nI am still in daily/weekly contact with a large network of my fraternity brothers.  We are all college grads; we have successful careers; work in a variety of different industries; make good money, and sincerely care about each others success.  In some way, almost all of us are in our current career positions due to our fraternity ties.  My last promotion was offered to me by a guy that wasn't in my fraternity, didn't go to my college, etc....however, whenever he read my fraternal accomplishments on my resume, he understood what I did.  He understood that I was a leader of men.  He did the exact same things, lived through the same thing, shared the same joys and tragedies...we moved the interview to happy hour after the formal part was over and we shared stories...no one even had a chance at my job after that.  I was in.  We shared a brotherhood experience.  I could go on and on.\n\nMany people think fraternities are all about parties and girls.  Well, that is part of it.  I mean, get any group of 18-22 year old guys together and what do you think they are all about?  It is normal.  There is so much more to it than that though....that is just the fun part!  Fraternities put you in a better position to be successful, to meet more people, meet more girls, get jobs, be involved in activities, sports and etc.\n\nIt is not for everyone I guess, but I wouldn't do it any other way.

__label__2 , Below is an answer. I don't understand. Explain.?,Crown glass is a soda-lime glass used to make lenses and prisms. It has a lower refractive index and less dispersion than flint glass, but is more durable. You can answer all your other questions using only the information in that sentence. \n\nSO FOR PRISMS, IS CROWN GLASS OR FLINT GLASS BETTER TO USE IN ORDER TO SHOW A NICE, HOT, BRIGHT, SPECTRUM AND TO STUDY IT?,Flint glass is better.  \n\nIn order to make a crisp, bright spectrum, you need to have a high refractive index -- this means that it will bend the light more as you scan across the wavelengths than the crown glass.  The crown glass will not bend the light as much, so the spectrum will be more mushed together than that from the flint glass.

__label__1 , How did Jesus walk on the water and heal people?,,I hesitate to answer you, because last time you added a detail that conveyed to me that you only want answers that agree with you. It seems to me that you are just baiting. \n\nBut, I'll give it a shot anyway...\n\nPerhaps he walked on water just like Criss Angel did.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBQLq2VmZcA\n\nThere's no evidence outside the Bible saying so that he did walk on water or that he healed anyone, though...\n\nThe Christian theological answer to how he did miracles was through the power of the Holy Spirit, which explains where it came from, but not how it worked.\n\nEdit...\n\nHis name is Christopher. My name is Christy. Does that mean I am evil, too, then? C'mon, hon, let's try to be open to the ideas of others at least and not just label them as evil. Other religions think that YOU are evil for believing what you do.\n\nA pentagram is a Pagan symbol, not a symbol of evil or Satan, no matter what your religion would have you think. Pagans do not worship or even believe in Satan.\n\nAnd no, I'm not saying he was an illusionist. Just showing you how it can be done as illusion and is not necessarily a supernatural event. \n\nThe rest of your response has nothing to do with this question. I know you haven't been here long, though, so I'll respond at length this time...  \n\nReligion does indeed slow progress. Can you give me one good reason why In vitro fertilization (where embryos are made and then destroyed) is Ok and accepted by this country where there are a lot of Christians, and yet stem cell research on those embryos (and we're talking VERY early stage embryos) is not accepted? \n\nChristianity does not make countries more advanced, more humane, etc... Countries that are predominantly Christian include - \n\nSouth Africa (apartheid), All of South and Central America, all of the Carribbean (with the exception of Cuba, which just barely falls short of being mostly Christian) and most of the Sub-Saharan African countries. That's over three dozen countries, in just those two regions of the world. There's also Eastern Europe to be considered, as well as countries that do not have Christianity (like Japan) and yet manage to be civilized and successful.\n\nSo, what's the real differences between a country that is developed, humane, and civilized and one that continues to be poor, unadvanced, or inhumane? \n\nGovernment and economy. The countries of the world that are richer, more advanced, and so on are so because they have governments and economical structures that have proven to be successful - democracies, capitalism, representative republics (like the US), and so on...  \n\nIncidentally, one thing that many of the more successful countries also have in common is that they have separation of church and state.

How long does it take each person, working alone, to type 100 pages?,This is simple algebra.  The rate thing 100 pgs / hr is a number as much as any number.  If we say X is the rate Marge types then Homer types at 2 * X and your equation is\n\n100 pgs/ 3 hrs = (2 * X) + X = 3 * X\n\nsolving for X we get Marge typing at 11.11 pgs/hr and Homer typing at 22.22 pgs/hr - So Marge will take 9 hours to do 100 pages on her own and Homer 3 hours.

__label__7 , what is  mr=mc?,,MR = MC\nA firm’s profit is defined as its total revenue minus its total cost. In symbols, p (Q) = R(Q) - C(Q). A firm that wishes to maximize its profits may find the corresponding output by differentiating p (Q) with respect to output and finding the output that equates the derivative to zero:\ndp (Q)/dQ = dR(Q)/dQ - dC(Q)/dQ = MR - MC = 0. That is, profit maximization requires that, if the firm chooses to produce anything at all, it should equate marginal revenue and marginal cost. In the specific case of competitive firms, this takes the form P = MC. The second-order condition is:\n -  < 0, or that marginal revenue cuts marginal cost from below.\nHowever, we know that the maximum found by the procedure above is only a local maximum. We also need to check that the output at the beginning of the range of possible output does not provide greater profits. Specifically, we need to check profits where output is zero. If output is zero, then revenue is zero, variable cost is zero, and profit equals p (0) = 0 - (FC + 0); the firm loses an amount equal to its fixed costs. Naturally, then, the firm would only select this option if its losses at the MR = MC output were greater than this. Let Q* be the output that satisfies the MR = MC rule. Total profits at this point will be p (Q*) = PQ* - (FC + VC(Q*)). Profits at Q = 0 will be higher than at Q = Q* if and only if p (0) = -FC > PQ* - (FC + VC(Q*)) = p (Q*). Dividing both sides of this inequality by Q* and rearranging, the firm maximizes profit at Q = 0 if and only if P <  , that is, if and only if the firm’s price is less than its average variable cost at the MR = MC output. Since average variable cost is equal to marginal cost at the former’s minimum, we can state the complete short-run profit-maximizing rule as follows: produce at the output for which MR = MC, provided price is greater than minimum average variable cost; otherwise shut down.

You are not going to read any further unless you are\nsitting down. Okay?\n\nWell, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital, and now I can see almost normally and only get those sick headaches one a day.\n\nFortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump were witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the Fire Department and the ambulance. He also visited me in the hospital and since I had nowhere to live because of the burnt out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. Its really a basement room, but its kind of cute. He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven't set the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show.\n\nYes, Mother and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child. The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has some minor infection which prevents us from passing the pre-marital blood test and I carelessly caught it from him. This will clear up with the penicillin injections I am now taking daily. I know you will welcome him into the family with open arms. He is kind and although not well educated, he is ambitious. Although he is of a different race and religion than ours, I know your often expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered by the fact that his skin color is somewhat different than ours. I am sure that you will love him as I do. His family background is good too, for I am told that his father is an important engineer for the sanitation department he works for.  Although they say he runs his office from his truck.\n\nNow that I have brought you up-to-date, folks, I want to tell you that there was NO dormitory fire, I did not have a concussion or a skull fracture, I was not in the hospital, I am not pregnant, I am not engaged, I do not have syphilis, and there is no schwartze in my life. However, I am getting a D in history and an F in science, and I wanted you to see those marks in the proper perspective.\n\nYour loving daughter, ...

__label__3 , Does anyone know what Neonatal ICU Nurse does?,I have to write a paper and need to know a general defintion of what   they do, thanks!,Neonatal intensive care nurses monitor and maintain the health of critically ill babies who are sent to neonatal intensive care units that are devoted to their care.\n\n\n\nSome babies are born prematurely (under 37 weeks gestation) and they need assistance because various systems and organs are not yet fully developed. Full term babies born with health problems, such as birth defects or infections, may be in the unit because they need special treatment, observation or surgery.\n\nOnce babies are admitted to the NICU, either directly from the delivery room, the newborn nursery, or from another hospital's NICU or nursery, working as part of a specialist team, neonatal intensive care nurses begin the constant monitoring of their young patients. \n\n\n\nWelcome To The NICU \n\nNIC nurses are trained in assessment. They monitor vital signs such as respiration, heart rate and temperature. This information assists the neonatalogist in planning treatment for the baby. \n\nDuring a baby's stay in a NICU, physical examinations and assessments of their condition are regularly carried out by the nurses. To help evaluate a baby's condition, blood, urine tests and x-rays may be arranged and conducted. Weighing and measuring the babies also enables the nurses to keep a check on their progress.\n\n\n\nBabies are monitored from their special beds or incubators, which are used to help keep their body temperature stable. Some may be wrapped in bubble plastic or glad wrap to help keep them warm.\n\nOn The Hour, Every Hour\n\n''NIC nurses do hourly observations, checking the baby's temperature, heart rate, pulse and blood pressure. If the baby is on a ventilator, then the nurse would also maintain the pressure and rate of the ventilator. All of this information, including every abnormality, is recorded,'' says a local neonatal nurse.\n\n\n\n\n\nNIC nurses are taught to be super diligent, they work according to a system and 'cutting corners' is something they simply cannot afford to do. \n\nNIC nurses work under the direction of neonatologists (pediatricians with additional training in newborn intensive care) and they also work closely alongside other NIC nurses, so teamwork is clearly critical in this profession. \n\nAll babies, especially very sick babies, need to be in contact with their parents. NIC nurses encourage a high level of contact between parents and their baby, while the baby is in intensive care. Parents also need to be kept fully informed about their baby's condition. \n\n\n\nNurses need to have very good people and communication skills, and to be supportive of parents with whom they spend a lot of time. It's very much the nurse's responsibility to teach parents how to care for their babies and to look for the signs that indicate something maybe wrong.\n\nVarious sources indicate that much of the pleasure of the job comes from it's very hands on nature, and the satisfaction that comes from getting to know babies and parents, who stay sometimes for a fairly long period of time. But, they also suggest that you need to be able to work in a team, cope with sometimes stressful situations and those irregular hours. \n\nThe development and dissemination of neonatal intensive care technology has been associated with improved survival rates for critically ill, newborn infants, some of whom are born many weeks ahead of their expected birth date.\n\n\n\nIndustry representatives and employment forecasters suggest that employment prospects are good for nurses in general. In Western Australia, there is a strong demand for the skills of NIC nurses but the workforce is still very small. \n\nAfter training, the intensive care nurse can expect to earn about $41,000 per year, which can go as high as $102,000 for a director of nursing.

__label__3 , Which martial art you think is better?,tell why,It all depends on what you're looking to gain from participating in a martial art.  I prefer Aikido because I think it has the best moral philosophy behind it.  The goal in training in Aikido is to be able to diffuse a conflict without bringing harm to yourself or your opponent.  This takes an a great deal of skill and training but it is worth it.  If you want an art that goes beyond the physical aspects of how to defend yourself and actually makes you a better person mentally, Aikido is the way to go.

If I buy him something expensive or really nice he's dissapointed. So find out what your guy is into (maybe a sports team, hobby, character, etc) and go with that. If it's what he's intrested in, you can't go wrong no matter what you think of it.

__label__10 , questions about department of family and children?,got custody of 2 kids last july, they have been in the state custody for years because their birth mother lost custody. They have NUMOUROS behavior problems, and have recently been diagnosed with reactive attatchment disorder. We have reached out for help in the community and through the department of family services. The services we got were for lack of a better word SAD! they just monitored or gave wishy washy answers, and solutions. Alot of what we have been told is very contradicting at times. we have opened our homes to ALL these people and told Dfacs when a situation arised. The kids have made some improvements but have there moments. recently one said he would kill us and the other child when we slept and he would kill himself. As per our instructions I called the consulor she said bring him to the er to get him to go to the state hos. when we arrived we met with a reg. e.r dr. who said we were bad parents i became upset now dfacs wants ME to take psch. test,do you think I shoul,they cant make you. sorry if this next bit upsets you but here goes. these kids will break everything & steal whatever they can sell. learn to enjoy whatever insane crap they like; music, friends, foods, language, ect.  lock your bedroom door at night & take self defense classes. seriously. expose them to arts, museums, politics, real (not government/public) education & enlightenment (has nothing to do with religion). put only things around them that will keep them mindfull of things that matter. teach them how to make money instead of falling into the various pop culture bs (gangs, drugs, drunks, hellraisers & badassses).\ni was hell bent crazy till about my mid 20s. i left home when i was 16 because i knew i was crazy & saw the sorrow i caused my mom. i played the hardasss & got into everything taboo & crazy that i could find. what ended it all for me is that i got sick of kicking the worlds asss & being a tyrant. none of my friends were really friends. none of them were worth a shlt or trustworthy. it was all useless. i took a long look at me & who was & could kick MY asss & directed my attention toward that. now im im my late 30s. ive learned how to work for myself because nobody would hire me with all the scars, tatoos & criminal records. my family is just now starting to trust me enough to let me into their lives. lucky for me theyre still alive. i have known good people for almost a decade that believe in & trust me. its refreshing. i finally feel a sense of peace. i hope this helps. help them develop their minds & useful tallents instead of slipping into a real life role of a b grade movie.\nhttp://scotthortonshow.com/\nmoney, http://www.philipdru.com/griffin_stream.html\nbush & clinton http://www.philipdru.com/triplett_stream.html\nisrael http://antiwar.com/justin/?articleid=8730\nhttp://www.philipdru.com/webb_stream.html\niran http://www.weekendinterviewshow.com/InterviewDisplay.aspx?i=131

__label__10 , What's a hate crime?,This term, hate crime, refers to a violent crime inspired by racially-charged hatred.  As a result, offenders can be given heavier sentences for the racial aspect of the said crime.  Here's my question:  what kind of violent crime ISN'T hateful?  Since when did someone commit a violent act out of love?  Is this just a tactic used by minority groups to serve their own interests?  Like it or not, people have the RIGHT to be racist, and until they commit a crime as a result of that racism, they can not be charged as criminals.  Therefore, racial motivation should play no role in the sentencing of the convict as racism alone is not illegal, but rather, only the violent acts that may follow are such.  You know where I stand at this point, now I want to hear what YOU think about these hate crimes.,I Believe that when a crime is committed because of a racial difference, then of course the offenders hatred should be brought to light. And Yes, violent crimes can be committed out of love. I'm sure you've heard about stalking. In some cases stalkers have been known to kill or attempt to kill their prey.They do it because they can't have that person, so they kill them  or attempt to kill them so no one else can have them. I used to live in the Mid-South, near a Klan ridden town. It was shameful watching the havoc they wreaked on innocent people.Hate crimes have been around since the Germans tortured the Jews, it's nothing new. If you hate someone, hate them for what they have done, not for their color or nationality.

__label__4 , should there be a ban on child-aimed TV ads?  Why?,,yes they should ban many of them.\nthe argument really simply is that children are to young to understand the potential harm and brainwashing of advertising. most kids TV stations have adverts that actively encourage the child to nag their parents for the product and encourage the child to behave badly if they don't get what they want. it is done very subtly so many parents who aren't actively watching the programme, which is the most common (kids in one room with TV, parents in nearby room or doing something else in the same room)don't notice the adverts message.\nIf an adult does not like an advert or isn't interested in the product they ignore it. it is not as simple for a child.\n\nMany of the large food and drink companies in US have realised that if you can, through adverts alone, get a child to associate fun and happiness with for example McDonald's then that child, into complete adulthood, when tested, will subconsciously want to eat McDonald's if they feel sad.
__label__10 , Can a Moldovan national apply for an American tourist visa? What about a Ukraine national?,,Yes, either national can apply to the US Embassy in their country.\n\nEach embassy has the right to decide if a person meets the requirements of obtaining a tourist visa, and some countries are easier than others.\n\nFor Ukraine (from personal experience) it is exceptionally difficult to obtain a tourist visa. A single, young woman has almost no chance of a tourist visa, even if she leaves a child behind, owns property, and has a good job. Especially if she speaks good English (because she's employable, and our standard of living is much better compared to theirs).\n\nI do not know the specifics of Moldova, other than it is difficult.
__label__7 , has anyone run across a real work from home company?,,Most people who work at home and are successful are doing one of two things - getting paid a commission on everyone they convince to join the program (also known as MLM or pyramid plans) OR they have their own business.

You create it based on your skills, your passions not on what someone else tells you is the GREATEST thing going.\n\nIf you are looking at one of the endless opportunities out there be careful - most are scams. Here are a few questions you should ask to help figure out if the one you are looking at is for real or not.\n\nLegitimate work-at-home program should tell you - in writing - what's involved in the program they are selling. Here are some questions you might ask:\n\n* What tasks will I have to perform? (Ask the program to list every step of the job.)\n* Will I be paid a salary or will my pay be based on commission?\n* Who will pay me?\n* When will I get my first paycheck?\n* What is the total cost of the work-at-home program, including supplies, equipment and membership fees?\n* What will I get for my money?

It was discovered by American physician, surgeon and endocrinologist Harvey Cushing (1869-1939) and reported by him in 1932.\n\nCushing's syndrome is also a relatively common condition in domestic dogs in which causes are the same as the syndrome in humans.

My point is this that terrorism is a major scarce in american today, yes there is terrorist in the untied states like back then there were commies living in the states, So do you believe Terrorism is the modern today for commies , where they choose to die before independence or the belief in Christianity?,Yes and no.  There has been a 'west vs. islam' battle going on for well over a thousand years predating even the crusades.  The current 'war on terror' is really a return to this ancient battle of cultures.  The only time that this was not in the forefront was the 80 some-odd years of fighting against communism.\n\nI pretty much agree with you and have been saying this to people since I watched the towers come down from my office in Manhattan.

__label__2 , Where do enzymes come from and what are their purpose?,,If you removed enzymes from the body, it would stop working and die! Enzymes are responsible for the functions of every organ. The body is a big efficient chemical factory and enzymes are needed for every chemical action and reaction.\n\nEvery gene's program is associated with the actions of enzymes. Even vitamins and nutrients can't be used effectively without enzymes.\n\nThe immune system's function is to fight off all foreign invaders in the body such as bacteria, viruses, carcinogens and other chemicals. It relies almost totally on enzymes to do its job. A weakened immune system has a diminished volume of enzymes which includes those that are defective or worn out. Enzymes have a limited life and must be replaced regularly.\n\nWhere do we get enzymes? Nine basic enzymes come from food, and the body takes these and changes them into over 3,000 varieties for various purposes.

This is also when your period should come. All this information should be included in the information packet you received with the pill pack. As long as you've been on the pills for more than a week (and it looks like you have) you are protected from pregnancy throughout the whole cycle. You are NOT protected from STIs/STDs though so if you and your partner haven't been tested you might consider using a condom.\n\nIf you are saying 3rd day off the pills meaning you've decided to not take hormonal birth control any more and stopped before finishing the entire pack, I'm not sure how long you're protected from pregnancy. It doesn't look like you mean that though so you are fine, and should be protected.

Which he was given, but him living that extra 15 years caused numerous problems for his family that never had to occur. So would you still ask for more time if you knew that the given time could effect others negatively.,Nope.  To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.  I wouldn't want 1 extra minute here when I could be in a glorified state with the Father.\n\nWhen He says it's time to go I'm outta here.

Not just basketball, but in the history of sports.  Take a look across the river at Rod Thorn with the Nets.  Thats an executive who knows how to get players that fit.\n\nHe is more than clueless on what this team needs and it shows in his drafts and this horrible trades.  Jim Dolan will go down as the worst owner in the history of sports too.  He should have fired Isiah (who still has a sexual harrassment charge pending against him) and let Larry Brown run both for a year.  Something tells me you would have seen improvement.\n\nWhats the worst thing that can happen?  The Knicks win 35 games and Dolan sees improvement and gives Thomas an extension!

__label__3 , how can I tell if my physiology makes me liable to become a drug addict if I ever tried dugs?,Straightforward question. I am not saying I plan to do drugs, so no preaching.,Short of some very unreliable and very expensive genetic testing - which may or may not provide a reliable answer, the best answer I can give you is to know yourself and your family history.\n\nYour odds of addition increase if you have any family member with an addiction problem. Your odds increase if you suffer from addiction to any other substance, item, relationship etc (meaning you have a so called addictive personality). Your odds also drastically increase if you are hanging around with others involved in such things, as familiarity breeds laxity in this case. Another physiological indication is if you have any problems with tolerance with any prescription meds such as pain killers - whether they dont affect you very much or kick your butt a lot  (both increasing your odds). Also, if there is a class of painkiller you dont respond to well - such as the 'caine family (lidocaine, lanocaine, supracaine - usually used by dentists) you can know something about your response to particular drug families (in this case, cocaine). \n\nI'm sorry this answer isnt more precise - but there is not a precise answer to your question.

This is driving me nuts....,WARNING: Anyone with an assumed mental condition should first see a competent, non-psychiatric physician to ensure that an undiagnosed, untreated PHYSICAL condition is not causing psychiatric symptoms. Such care can save a person from being subjected to the abusive and damaging treatments rendered by psychiatrists. \n\nMike\n\n--\n\nPS. I am absolutely disgusted by some of the above replies - how quick so many people are to judge that someone is ill or deluded by a short Yahoo Answer question. It's absolutely ridiculous. And to the poster that linked to Schizophrenia.com I defy you to find anything more atrocious than this segment: ...if the person who has schizophrenia is over the legal age (typically 19 years old), families or friends -- after trying every possible method to get help for their family member -- may end up lying and just saying that the family member is suicidal, or has attempted to harm others. This satisfies the legal requirements that a person is a danger to self or others and can be treated involuntarily.* Sick.\n\nIf you talk to God, you are praying; \nIf God talks to you, you have schizophrenia.\nIf the dead talk to you, you are a spiritualist; \nIf God talks to you, you are a schizophrenic.\n\nThomas S.

__label__4 , where can i get a good job without a high school diploma in california?,,Your question begs all manner of smartazz answers, but to be serious and perfectly blunt, your odds of finding a decent job as a high-school dropout are very slim. There are a lot of factors that will make it hard. Most importantly, by dropping out of high school you are voluntarily stepping to the back of the line when it comes to getting a job. All else being equal, companies will hire a person who has proven that they have the persistence to complete school and not even consider you. That alone sets you back. Another strike against you is that many jobs require at the very minimum a high school diploma or a GED. You can't even hope to interview with them without one. Basically you will spend the rest of your life competing against other dropouts for the crappy low-paying jobs. But if that's really where you see your dreams taking you, then there's no better time to quit school than tomorrow morning.

__label__4 , What does sub-par mean?,,if you don't know, par is a golfing term. It is the approximate rating of difficulty for each hole. Only better golfers actually make par regularly. When a golfer shoots below par, that is EXCELLENT! Only the very best players can do that regularly. Somehow, the meaning or the words sub-par or below par as used outside of the game of golf, have become unfavorable, anything but excellent! Par doesn't really mean normal or average. It is more of a target to try for. If your effort doesn't measure up to that target, you effort is sub-par.

Its need 100% team-effort to win a vital match. It is true that the world best players are playing for Real Madrid, but maximum of them are aged. They are now not as good as they had before four years. So the efficency of team is quite low than other renowned team like Barcilona, Villareal, Real Jaragoja, AC & Inter Milan, Juventas, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Man United, Benfica etc. Not only that, the ego problem is also ruin the team efforts of Real Madrid. The coach is unable to control those super stars. The Real Madrid Management have change their coach several times in recent past. I hope they will overcoma this problem and contract with some young star footballer like Henri, C. Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Kaka, Mesi, Balack, etc. in future.

I would like to stay afvter school and talk to him but i dont know how to ask him. How would I do that?\n\nMost importantly though will he be mad?,he's a teacher. if you trust him 100% and have a good student/teacher relationship, there shouldn't be any issues with asking him. ask him before or after class, if he's not your teacher, then ask him right before or right after school. he's there to help and support you. most teachers are because they want to help kids out.\n\nhow to approach it? mister smith, i hurt my knee the other day ding something and i'm kinda scared to tell my parents about it because i don't want to get in trouble. do you think i should see a doctor about this? he'll probably say, well, let's take a look at it....  and he will let you know what he thinks. he may lecture you for not wanting to tell mom or dad, but, that's because he's a teacher and he cares.\n\ngood luck!

__label__2 , immunologist, endocronologist job description?,,Immunology is a broad branch of biomedical science that covers the study of all aspects of the immune system in all organisms. It deals with, among other things, the physiological functioning of the immune system in states of both health and disease; malfunctions of the immune system in immunological disorders (autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivities, immune deficiency, allograft rejection); the physical, chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the immune system in vitro, in situ, and in vivo. Immunology has various applications in several disciplines of science, and as such is further divided.\n\n\n\nEndocrinology is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the endocrine system and its specific secretions called hormones. Hormones are molecules that act as signals from one type of cells to another. Most hormones reach their targets via the blood. Although every organ system secretes and responds to hormones (including the brain, lungs, heart, intestine, skin, and the kidney), the clinical specialty of endocrinology focuses primarily on the endocrine organs, meaning the organs whose primary function is hormone secretion. These organs include the pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, ovaries and testes, and pancreas.\n\nAn endocrinologist is a doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the endocrine system, such as diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and many others (see list of diseases below). A disease due to a disorder of the endocrine system is often called a hormone imbalance, but is technically known as an endocrinopathy or endocrinosis.

__label__3 , can somebody tell me how can i lose fats from my belly and change it into muscles, or abs?,,Ofcourse you can't change fat into muscle, you need to lose the fat first. I'm not sure if there are any diets where you lose fat from your belly first except Jorge Cruise's 3-hour diet, because with that diet you eat every 3 hours which keeps your metablolism revved up. I quote Cruise,  In the New England journal of medicine, they published a study. In the study they specifically showed that eating every three hours reduced the stress hormone called cortisol. That's why belly fat goes down -- the reduction in cortisol. When you have high levels of this cortisol hormone, it's closely associated to abdominal fat. In this study it was shown that in as little as two weeks, individuals who ate frequent small meals, as opposed to three large meals, containing the same amount of calories, just breaking them down over time, over six meals versus three, they were able to reduce cortisol levels by more than 17%. That was just in the first two weeks -- it was wonderful. When you do this long term, the body gets efficient at staying low in cortisol level and that's what you want. That the how you stay slim and trim; with belly fat especially, it's all about removing the stress hormone cortisol. \nCheck out the diet.. its actually very easy because you're never hungrey and you don't eliminate any kind of food.\n\nAfter you lose the fat fom your belly, you need to start doin excercises that target the belly area and thus build muscle.\nGood luck!

If you are peeved at a person's personal preference, then how are you more deep?  People like what they like.  A plain girl with a fun or interesting personality will garner as much attention as a attractive one.  A beautiful girl with a bad attitude will be almost as damning.\n\nThink of it this way:  A girl who is obsessing about pretty girls is not interesting or fun to be around.

Please,I really need an honest answer,maybe from someone who has experienced this.Maybe you also have some tips on jogging too.Thank you all who answer.,Jogging is one of the best things you can do to lose weight. If you are doing it along with healthy eating then you will do fine. Just make sure you eat enough, because you'll need plenty of energy to jog. Porridge for breakfast is perfect as it fills you up til lunch and provides good energy for running. Eat plenty of bananas too. Just don't skip meals as this will not help you lose weight at all. i would start off going out for 15 mins at a time, see how you feel and then the next week, increase it by 5-10 mins. You will get fitter and fitter. Just start off steady.

__label__9 , how can u tell if a girl has a boyfriend?,,What difference does it make? All girls (over 14) have a boyfriend.\n\nI don't recall ever meeting a woman that did not claim to have a boyfriend.\n\nIf you are going to let that stop you, you might want to buy one of those blow-up dolls, you'll need it.
__label__3 , ho wlong does it take to find out if ur pregnant?,I quit my birth control 2 weeks before I had sex with my boyfriend could I be pregnant? Its been 2 weeks since then,Yes, you could be pregnant.  It will take you longer to find out if you are pregnant than if you weren't on birth control, because sometimes it takes a while for your body to get back on a cycle after you quit birth control, so it is not abnormal to not have a period for six or eight weeks after you go off and that may not necessarily mean you are pregnant.  I would give it three more weeks and then test.  It won't hurt.  But if you get a negative, it doesn't necessarily  mean you are not.  The only way to know for sure is to get a blood or urine test done.  If you got pregnant two weeks ago they would know by now with a blood or urine test.
__label__6 , how many of us need to reconnect with nature?,the last time i went camping i was freaking out when i heard raccoons in the middle of the night and when i jumped in the lake i freaked out that fish would swim up against my legs eyeyeyeye...i need help lol,I think everyone should spend at least one night in their lifetime in the woods alone. Bring a blanket. Lie on the ground, stare up at the wonder that is the night sky and listen. When was the last time most people really listened without hearing a car alarm or cell phone? You need to get as far away from the city lights as possible to really appreciate this. From where I am I can see the outer edge of the Milky Way on a moonless night.
__label__3 , does anyone know if its ok to go in the pool with my period ? wont the clorox or chlorine affect me?,,Swimming in the pool is fine, wear the tampon. Make sure you keep the string hidden from embracing you. You will not produce enough blood to harm anyone, the chemicals will disinfect any leakage. Also remember not to take and use a white towel, use a darker colored one to help conceal and leakage when drying off.\n\n Special Note: when scuba diving if a lady is on her period sharks will not be drawn to them. Blood expelled is dead not what sharks sense,

__label__1 , what do u tink abt kundalini awakening?,i am start doing this meditation and i want to know more abt it.,Over a period of time you will come across people who will give you lots of varieties of advice.\n1. first remember that meditation is solely for control over the senses.To the person who practices, his main aim should be to control the wavering of the  mind. Dawn and dusk are excellent periods for such practices.\n2. Meditation doen't mean merely concentrating for a few hours. You HAVE TO practice the following:\n                 SEE NO EVIL\n                 HEAR NO EVIL\n                 SPEAK NO EVIL\n                 THINK NO EVIL\nThe first and last are of paramount importance.Lapses in the above result in the kundalini slipping back to it's original place. But if you suceed, over a period of time, the kundalini shakti comes up to it's zenith and your mental and intellectual power are extremely enhanced. \n         So good luck. You are on the right path and remember it needs lots of practice and patience.

__label__7 , How do you get paint off a jacket sleeve?,,That depends, is it oil based or latex? Latex will rinse out at first, but if it is dry, you wanna get real hot water and soak it till the paint starts to come off, then launder, but don't dry in dryer til you are sure spot is out. Dryer will set the stain. If it is oil based paint, some thinner will get it out, but make sure as soon as you get the paint out, you wash out the thinner too. Either way, if you have already dryed it in dryer, you better fall in love with that stain, cause it's there to stay.
__label__4 , Should I go to Northern Arizona University or University of Arizona?,,Northern Arizona University is in Flagstaff; University of Arizona is in Tucson.  The only thing I know about Tucson is that it is hot, hot, hot.  Flagstaff is actually a very nice town, if you can afford it.  I've been to the campus of Northern Arizona U., and it is a pleasant place.  I know nothing of the academic programs of U. Arizona, but I saw the catalog of Northern Az. U., and it looked pretty interesting to me.  I'd vote for NAU.  (And don't forget the Lowell Observatory is in Flagstaff; fascinating!)

__label__1 , For Muslims...?,if it is so great to kill yourself for God then why isnt there a steadiy stream of Muslim boys killing themselves to get to heaven. By now there shouldnt be any Muslim men left in the world. I am sorry if i dont understand this correctly or if this sounds rude or racist its not meant too so please take no offense. I would just like to know why all Muslim men arent lining up to kill themselves for the virgins and the promise of God that you preach. Can any of you tell me? Once again i am sorry if i offend any Muslims as its not my intentions.,Suicide is a great sin in Islam and suicide bombers are not in any way real muslims, they are only muslim by name. I don't know where they got the impression that killing themselves would take them to heaven because that is SO untrue. The word jihad has nothing to do with holy war. It basicaly means to fight for your rights as a muslim. Example, many muslim women are experiencing difficulty wearing the veil these days, so for a woman to go out wearing the veil anyways in like jihad. She is strong in her beliefs and is doing something that in no way harms anyone else. I hope this helps.

I dont know who is doing it, and really dont know any of my neighbors well. We bought our house over a year ago and only one neighbor has even talked to us. We live close to a church and I believe that most of the neighbors go there, we are not members though. How can I keep myself from wanting to hurt them when they call the city on mr for no reason. I cant help but think that It might be because my husband and I are in a biracial marriage. Any suggestions?,I'm in the same boat,we just bought our house in sept. and the neighbors have decided for whatever reason that they don't care for us.At first it really bothered me, but I've decided that I'm the better person for just ignoring their stupidity,I wave at them tell them to have a nice day,and just go about my buisness.I'll be damned if I'm gonna let them ruin my happiness with my new home,or rain on my parade.Hold your head high,alot of church-going,holier than thou are the biggest hypocrites on earth,they don't know the first thing about being christians.Their shallow and jealous,just go about your life and the good ones will come around.Good-Luck.Don't feel like you have to preach to them or win them over,like I said just walk with your head high,if you try to preach at them it will only feed their ignorance.Please Paul,find a congregation that wants to hear all that!

Is it true?,It is constantly expanding.  So it is impossible to give an accurate sizing that will last for more than a few moments in time.\n\nSadly, because of the size of the universe and the vast number of light years that it is across, by the time we figure out how big it is at any given time in our relative timespace the universe has already expanded exponentially.

Well, whose to say?  Unconventional to society as a whole?  To a religious group?  In general, one can argue that all lifestyles can be classified as unconventional.\n\nSociety tends to hold the idea of an unconventional lifestyle as one that is separated from society.  Loving art, nature, etc. more that wealth, success, etc. is a good example.  For Bohemians, they rejected private property and materialism by having no permanent residence anywhere and by surviving on little material wealth. They also rejected strict moral values by living carefree lives of alcohol and drug use, as well as open sexual freedom. \nThey rejected the pursuit of wealth by living solely for art and literature's sake, pursuing their passions regardless of whether they gained an income, which they usually did not. \nTo most societies, this is an unconventional lifestyle.
__label__10 , how do i go live in america easily? i want to work too but getting a visa is hard and complicated?,,I'm sorry to say but there is really not much of a chance, especially, not a easy one.\n\nGetting married remains the easiest, unfortunately same sex marriages are not recognized by the federal government.\n\nYou can try the Diversity Visa Lottery program, if you are lucky you can win a permanent residency.\n\nWork permits are generally granted to highly qualified professionals (minimum bachelor's degree) if you are one you have a chance.\n\nIf you are young you can try some work exchange program.\n\nOther then that you can stay in the US 6month per year as a tourist but you can't work.\n\nThis is exactly why there are so many illegals, it is very difficult to immigrate legally.

__label__3 , What causes Celica Sprue?,,Celiac sprue (AKA celiac disease or Gluten-Sensitive Enteropathy), is a chronic disease of the digestive tract.  It is a *genetic* disease that is characterized\nby autoimmune damage to the mucosal lining of the small intestine when gluten is ingested.\n\nPeople with CS cannot tolerate gluten in any form (gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, barley and some oats).  When gluten is ingested by people with the disease, the mucosa of their intestines is damaged by an immunologically mediated inflammatory response, which results in maldigestion and malabsorption.\n\nSymptoms vary but can include severe gas pain, stomach pain, malodorous and oily stools and/or profuse diarrhea, and weight loss.\n\nBecause it is a genetic, inheritable disease, there is no true prevention.  However, there are things that can be done to help manage it, most notably, dietary changes.\n\nThe Celiac Sprue Association can be very helpful to those interested in or living with the disease.  You can see them online at http://www.csaceliacs.org.  Hope that helps.
__label__5 , What ports does FTP traffic travel over?,,FTP is commonly run on two ports, 20 and 21, and runs exclusively over TCP. The FTP server listens on port 21 for incoming connection from FTP clients. A connection on this port forms the control stream, on which commands are passed to the FTP server. For the actual file transfer to take place, a different connection is required. Depending on the transfer mode, the client (active mode) or the server (passive mode) can listen for the incoming data connection. Before file transfer begins, the client and server also negotiate the port of the data connection. In case of active connections (where the server connects to the client to transfer data), the server binds on port 20 before connecting to the client. For passive connections, there is no such restriction.
__label__8 , Why is Science Fiction considered geeky or nerdy?,,Its to do with intellect. A nerd or geek (Americanisms, Phtoo!) is an intellectual who has achieved a state of interest in something other than sports and sex. In the case of Science Fiction those who are challenged by anything more complicated than basic needs are not interested because they have to work to hard to get it. Its just that its an exciting genre through conceptual stimulation. And the Down that comes from those who consider themselves above it through their own physical beauty, prowess or popularity is really a reflection of their own shallowness. Don't let the In crowd spoil your fun Science Fiction allows access to creative places like no other concept.

My case worker said I had 0 errors on my application and it was the first time she had ever seen that.  I hear of stories where people get denied, go through appeals, have to hire attornies and this is years later for the same situation as myself.  I heard today I was approved and will take 30 days to get money but it has only been 3 months.  I find it hard to believe that it is so hard for some people in the same boat I am.  Why is it hard?  What are the denial reasons people get?,I was diagnosed with MS May '05.  I applied for SSI last October, and was approved for Presumptive Disability.  I received 3 checks, then they denied me.  I appealed, and was denied again.  Now I am on the third appeal.  I hired a retired Social Security representative, and will be going before an administrative law judge within the next 2 months.  He told me that was just the way it was.  So many people get denied the first time, and never appeal, that Social Security tries its best to screw you.  But they will have to keep hearing my case until I exhaust all options.  But hopefully I can win this damn case!

__label__2 , How do you inscribe a reular square in a circle?,How would you inscribe an octagon in a circle?,To incribe a regular quadrilateral (ie sqare) into a circle with only a compass and straight edge do the following:\n\n1. Draw a circle. Label the center A.\n\n2. Draw a diameter of the circle by placing your straight edge on the center of the circle. Label the points where the diameter intersects the circle as B and C.\n\n3. Set your compass to a wider amount than you used to draw your circle.\n\n4. Without adjusting your compass, draw a circle with B as the center.  \n\n5. Without adjusting your compass, draw another circle with C as the center. \n\n6. Your two new circles will intersect at two points. Use your straight edge to draw a line through these two points.\n\n7. This new line will intersect the original circle at two points. Label those points as D and E. \n\n8. B, C, D, and E are the corners of your inscribed square. You can use your straight edge to draw the edges of the square.\n\nReason this works:\n\nIn steps 4 through 6, you contructed the perpendicular bisector to the diameter of the original circle.\n \nThis means that segment DE is a diameter of the orignal circle (since it passes through the center of the circle). This also means segment BC and DE form a right angle. \n\nIf you look at triangles BAD and DAC; BA, AD, AC are all radii of the original circle (and thus the same length). Therefore the triangles are exact copies of each other and BD and DC are the same legth. This logic will show you that all the sides are the same length.\n\nAngle DBE inscribes one half of the original circle since DE is the diameter of the circle. This makes DBE a right angle. Similar logic will show you all angles of your square are right angles. \n\nSince your sqare has all equal sides and all equal angles, it is a square.

I am pretty breathless on any excertion, so a light walk is all I'll do. You have all helped and explained alot more to me than the our doctors here.\n\nThank you again x Aged 40,I would strongly encourage you to bypass the medical system and pay for an angiogram out of pocket if need be. I had a 100% blockage and even with a private health care system I had to wait a few days. \n\nKeep your nitro tablets on you at all times and stay close to a hospital. I do not mean to scare you but you are facing a very serious situation. For some reason everyone gets blase about heart problems unless they are the ones with the problem. If you go to the emergency room they are pretty much obligated to treat you. At least that is the case here in the States. I would not recommend getting on a plane and going anywhere. I found out about my problem at 29000 feet. It was right after 9/11 and I thought I was having an anxiety attack. It turns out I was blocked. \n\nTake care and I wish you the best.

She is one of my best friends and she doesn't know how I feel about her and I want her to know but I don't want her to know.   I want her to know because I might actually have a chance with her but I don't want to screw our friendship up.

It's a sticky situation.,I'm guessing you didn't have too close a relationship with your father to be able to see his wife sexually let alone have sex with her. Stay away from her and keep letting your Dad know how sorry you are, I don't think this is something that will smooth over quickly but you may regain part of your relationship with your father with some time, depending on how close the two of you are. Stay away from that woman no matter what happens! Good Luck

Maybe one day whites and blacks can be real friends, but right now the country ain’t built that way. Now you could be right ‘bout Jeremy making a much finer friend that T.J. ever will be. The trouble is, down here in Mississippi, it costs too much to find out...,It's talking about the fact that, during the time in which the story is set, it isn't safe for black people to cross over into the somewhat forbidden world of white people. Even if they could manage to find some people who weren't bigots and were willing to befriend them, there were plenty of other whites who WERE bigoted and might try to hurt them for infiltrating.\n\n\n\nps-- do your own homework. it's a great book and it'd do you good to read it carefully and really think about it.

__label__1 , How do you think of God? What makes you think this way?,No matter how clearly the Bible or other religious texts try to describe God, we will all still have our own opinions... So, What is God like to you? Is God a man or a woman? Does God control every aspect of your life, or does God simply guide you? Is God a father-like figure in the clouds, or something else? Where did God come from? Is God loving or angry? Does God even care? You don't have to answer all of these of course, just give me a general idea if you want. Thanks :),I believe in God because in studying physics, you find that everything has an explanation.  If you drop a ball from 100 meters, you can calculate how long it will take to hit the ground.  All you need to know is the acceleration of gravity, the air resistance, etc.  But you can't do that with humans.  Even if a supercomputer plotted out every atom in a person's body, physics, or any science for that matter, couldn't account for his actions.  Therefore, there must be something that gives us choice.  I don't think God controls us, but he did give us free agency, and we will be judged according to how we use our free agency.

When did asking race questions make a person racist anyway? How else do you ask these questions without pointing away from the question itself. A great question is a question that gets to the point the fastest. It's also one that gets the most responses. Look at my hits before you judge my questions. Go to the next one if you don't like my taste. This is my arena!!!!!!,One should be allowed to ask whatever questions they want and it left up to Yahoo to decide if it is over the line.  I find any kind of censorship an affront.

__label__8 , What was Captain Hook's name before the accident?,,You are ALL wrong. It was Captain James Shaft. \n\nThe true story of Captain James Hook, the pirate supreme of Never Never Land is a closely guarded secret. If the truth got out, children would be truly terrified. \n\nLong ago in the land of Never Never, Tinkerbelle was married to the gorgeously divine fairy price Jimmyshaft. You see, Bell is her maiden name she was once known as Tikershaft. Any who, one day the young child Peter arrived in Never Never Land and Tinkerbelle asked her husband if that could take him in. Jimmyshaft, being the kind fairy he was agreed. But after a time, Tinker started to fall in love with Peter, as any mother figure would.  Jimmyshaft got very jalousie because all of Tinks time was spent looking after Peter. She didn’t have time to play fairy games and use her magic to make Jimmyshaft happy all the time. One day, Jimmyshaft got so mad that he took a frying pan from the kitchen and hit pan in the head. Tinkerbelle got so mad that she through Jimmyshaft out of the house. This of course caused all sorts of rumors and destroyed the princes image. He was so ashamed that he exiled himself from the rest of the fairy folks and went to live with all the other bad fairs and imps. \n\nOne day many years later, Jimmyshaft saw Peter playing by the water. He pushed Peter in the water. As he did, he started laughing and yelled out, Look at the little pan head sink. Much to Jimmyshafts surprise, Peter knew how to swim. Peter got out of the water and tried swat Jimmyshaft, but he was just too quick and too small. Peter called out, if you were just a little bigger, I'd beat you silly. \n\nFor a long time this continued. Jimmyshaft would play a prank on Peter calling him pan head and Peter, now known as Peter Panhead, would yell out, If you where just a little bigger.  \n\nEventually, after a long time passed, Jimmyshaft was tired of the game.  The final straw was when his now ex-wife Tinkerbelle taught Peter how to fly. He knew the only way he would ever get rid of the pesky Peter Panhead now was to drown him in the sea, but Jimmyshaft was just too small to do the job. So Jimmyshaft used the last of his fairy magic and turned himself and all of the fallen fairies and imps into pirates. There one solitary mission was to destroy the poor Pater Panhead. \n\nThe rest of the story you know. The pirates agreed that Jimmyshaft should be the captain but Captain Jimmyshaft just didn’t sound frightening so he changes his name to Captain James Shaft. But on the very first crusade to get Peter, Peter got the best of the old Pirate Captain and the Crock got his hand. This earned Peter the respect of the other inhabitants of Never Land and they stopped calling him Pan head and simply called him Pan...This later became a time like Khan or Lord. (see the Move Hook as reference.) And the now one handed Pirate Captain James Shaft was forever known as James Hook.\n\nWell, what do you think!  It doesn’t matter, because that's my story and I'm stick'n to it.

__label__10 , To all the idiots that do not READ the freaking questions:  Don't answer them as you look so damned stupid!,Here we go again! READ the EFFIN question if you want to answer and then answer the QUESTION!\nnot insults, not give another question no tangents!\nA person is just a person, until he/she breaks the law!  \nWhat law determines what kind of person.  We even recognize this in our laws, Civil infractions (5 over speed limit- civil infraction, 50 over felony)\nAS well as it being black and white right/wrong, there exist degrees of HOW BAD not degrees of how good.\nI am extra law abiding < doesn't exist\nN illegal aliens\nyes legal immigrants\nno muslim immigrants because islam has declared war on isreal and it's allies, and directly against the US over 100 times! you do not allow enemy soldiers behind the lines\nThese are NOT RACIALLY based views at all!\nif I tell you that my family has declared war against your family and that we will kill any of you if we get the chance, would you allow ANY of my family to visit you (assuming you do not know any of us)?,Just some advice...sometimes, it's difficult to discern specifically what you want answered, and most people aren't going to read a whole volume of material.  If you want a simple answer, ask a simple, one line, question.\n\nThis question reads more like a 'rant' than a question, and I'm left wondering if you really WANT a response, or if you're just spouting off.\n\nAnd, no, I'm not going to invite thugs into my kitchen.

__label__8 , Chris angel?,Whats so good about him? Who is he anyways?,He's the latest and greatest illusionist/magician/money-maker. His popularity has skyrocketed since David Blaine failed his Houdini under-water gig. Check him out on the Sci-Fi channel to see some amazing and innovative tricks. If you have TiVo, you'll definitely be rewinding and using the slow-motion buttons on your remote just to see if you can figure out how he did what he did. There is this one episode a season or two ago where he stuck his hand right through a man's chest that was so outrageous you had to rewind it just to make sure you saw what you thought you saw. It's entertainment and it will definitely suspend reality as you know it for the time that you watch his show.
__label__1 , A woman who had an abortion in their past but is now pro-life...why do so-called pro-choice people feel,justified in calling her a hypocrite?\n\nWhat about a former smoker who quit and lost a lung and who now lobbies against the tobacco industry and has devoted their life to educating people about the dangers of smoking? Would any of you people call that person a hypocrite?\n\nWhat about an alcoholic who had to have a liver transplant and lost his family because of alcohol and now is the leader of an AA group? Would any of you people call that person a hypocrite?\n\nSmoking is legal. Alcohol is legal. Abortion is legal. But the fact that these things are legal makes none of them wise, healthy, or moral. They are all things that have the power to destroy lives. They are all things that are destructive to families. They are all things that cause damage to physical and emotional health down the road. They are all things that the abusers do with their own bodies.\n\nWhy is only the pro-life woman who has had an abortion in her past called a hypocrite?,I would not justify calling her a hypocrite. The only way she would be a hypocrite is if she was againts abortion, but having abortions of her own. It goes for smoking or drinking. Their is nothing wrong with her educating the public about her expierence. An example of this would be a person that smokes and tells another person that he/she shouldn't smoke. That person would be called a hypocrite. If the person quit for good then she would not be a hypocrite becouse she/he doesn't do it anymore.

__label__8 , Who was the most dumbest person you have ever met?,First off...\n- Where did you meet them?\n- Internet does not count!  You had to have actually physically met them in person.\n- I do not count unless you actually met me in person.\n- President Bush nor any politician actually count, unless you actually met them in person.\n\nFor me..\nSecond day of Navy Basic Training.  Some very stupid guy was talking about how much weed he smoked right before shipping out (Which we were all given urine test about an hour within we arrived!), A Petty Officer was telling us about the GI bill, the Petty Officer cracked some lame joke, everyone laughed, he said I don't get it. someone said to him How can you NOT get it?, then he explained it to him uhuhuhuhu... now I get it.  Through out the orientation he kept talking and the RDCs kept yelling at him to shut-up.\n Later that day, the Master-At-Arms came for him and a few other people.,The guy in your answer is pretty dumb, but I know someone dumber.\n\nI work at a police department and one night we arrested an extremely drunk man driving. We brought him in, booked him, he bailed out and left. Two minutes later, my sergeant saw him getting in a car in the police station parking lot and driving off. His sober girlfriend had come to bail him out, then let him drive home. What the heck? So this guy got busted for OUI twice in a span of less than an hour. Oh, and the second time, he wasn't allowed to bail, because he had violated his bail conditions from the previous OUI. Eeeeeboy.

__label__9 , Response, Is It Worthy It?,I just asked a question and I have one response to the question. Here is the original question.\n\nI am a first year in college. There is this girl that I like in my hall. At first, I thought she might like me so I just waited to see if anything more developed. It has been several months and now I am about 95% sure she only likes me as a friend. I think there is a better chance that I will damage our friendship by telling her how I feel. Should I tell her how I feel, is it worth it? \n\nIf I wait there is a chance that she may get a boyfriend, not me, or we may gradually loose touch. Should I still just wait and see?,Hello I think what you should do is give her hints that you like her more than friends action speaks louder than words and soon enough she'll get the hint and , you will eventually know if she likes you the same way ,because she will react on it, you will soon know if she likes you more than friends, if you tell her how you feel and she dont feel the same way towards you might loose her as well by making her feel uncomfortable around you, so you dont want to do that, at least by giving her hints you will get the answer without asking her or making her feel awkward.\nTake care and Goodluck

__label__10 , If people believe Islam is a violent religion, why don't they just read the Quran for themselves?  It's not!,If you read the Quran, it says To kill one person, it is as if you killed all of humanity.  If you saved one person, it is as if you saved all of humanity.,I agree with you whole-heartedly.  The actions of terrorists in the name of Allah and Islam brings shame on good Muslims everywhere.  \n\nHowever, I do see one issue that people of faith need to address.  Very few Imams have publicly condemned the actions of terror groups and set the record straight on Islam.  This is a serious error on their part.  By their silence, they appear to give endorsement to these actions.  Even American Imams have failed to do this on a large scale.  Why this is, I cannot say as I am neither Imam nor Muslim.  \n\nI can say that good people of faith -- all faiths -- need to speak out loudly and clearly in condemnation of terror in the name of any religion.  Anything less deprecates the faith and gives aid and comfort to those who have neither love nor faith in their hearts.

__label__2 , How to count the tangential velocity?,I was wondering about how to count it, what is it exactly. Can we say that some objects move with the velocity bigger than c? Eg. when a supernova explodes, we can observate it from a distance on a screen. When we add more details about the situation and the shape of the screen, we can say about the velocities bigger than c. What are those details? :),Hi. There is a star being watched very closely by astronomers because it may be a new type of supernovae. The light 'echoes' from reflecting gas and dust seem to move at a speed greater than 'c'. This is not due to anything actually MOVING. Just the lit up areas expand in a tangential fashion. : http://www.habitablezone.com/space/messages/444552.html

It will have a tube of itch cream that you might want to keep in your purse.  Yogurt does have microorganisms in it, but not nearly enought.  You also can buy Acidopholus in the vitamin section.

And if you don't need glasses then you can go back to your doctor, but eye strain can cause really bad headaches.

How do we as a society go about changing the laws to make it legal. Also how can it be legal in Colorado but not everywere else in the US? What do we need to do to change things? Alcohol kills people every day. Weed does not. I think that alcohol should be the illegal one...\nI know that i will get negitive responces to this one and if you are against this read this... \nhttp://www.world-mysteries.com/marijuana1.htm,I think a lot of it being legal depends on the tobacco companies. It's simply competition for them if weed is sold legally. And since they have so much lobbying power it would be hard.\n\nBut I somewhat agree with you on this one. People will smoke weed regardless if it's legal or not, so why not take control of it and legalize it and make them pay for it and tax it?

__label__2 , what is the cellular and molecular basis of muscle contraction,including the roles of actin, myosin, Ca+2, ATP,,1. At the neuromuscular juncture, ACh released by the synaptic terminal binds to receptors on the sarcolemma.\n\n2. The resulting change in the transmembrane potential of the muscle fiber leads to the production of action petential that spreads across the entire surface of the muscle fiber and along the T tubules.\n\n3.The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases stored calcium ions, increasing the calcium concentration of the sarcoplasm in and around the sarcomeres.\n\n4. Calcium ions bind to triponin, producing a change in the orientation of the troponin-tropomyosin complex that exposes active sites on the thin filaments (actin).  Cross-bridges form when myosin heads bind to the active sites on F actin.\n\n5. The contraction begins as repeated cycles of cross-bridge binding, pivoting, and detatchment occur, powered by the hydrolysis of ATP.  These events produce filament sliding, and the muscle fiber shortens.

Anyway, I think he really liked the softer sell version that I came up with and may use it to see if he can get his goals met...Anyway, I was thinking that I could make some money helping others do the same?  Is there a restriction from my soliciting people thru Match.  Or any other ideas.  My re-write was really good!,

__label__6 , is 4 months long enough to train for marathon iam running about 6 miles now?,,I'd assume you have 4 more months to train, but that should be a good amount of time. Gradually increase you average distance and don't run the same amount everyday obviously. Do a couple of 10 mile days and then on one day run 15. This'll get you used to suddenly running a lot because it'd obviously be torture on your body to run 26 miles everyday. But you could do that once in a while during your training, it'd be a good idea.

Your recruiter (if he did his job) answered all of your questions, told you about programs that you may be qualified for and helped you make an informed decision.  \n\nWhat he didn't tell you is what you didn't ask about or told him you weren't interested in.  Why would he go on about how great the GI Bill is when you already told him you weren't really interested in college.  If you told your recruiter that you wanted to be play with explosives, why would he tell you about all the great opportunities in administrative fields.  \n\nLook, there aren't any real secrets out there.  You have a brother, cousin or friend in the NG ask them or ask your recruiter.  Your NG recruiter has to do something you average AD recruiter doesn't... he has to see you every drill weekend.  It's not in his interest to fill you up with too much BS.\n\nYes, we ALL know that you may fall into a rotation in Afghanistan or here in Iraq with me... don't sweat it.  It's a post 9/11 world and military service is never going to be the same again.

__label__1 , I think they should make Pope John Paul II the Patron Saint for those with Parkinson's disease. Do you?,,I think it'd certainly be appropriate, if a touch specific.  Perhaps the Patron of those with muscular disease.  This would include parkinsons but would also include Mononucleosis, muscular dystrophy, etc.  Rather more inclusive while still being appropriate.  Perhaps neurological disease as well, since Parkinson's is primarily neurologic in nature.

__label__1 , Serious question for christians,can you truely interpet this dream for me? (see details)?,In my lifetime I have had four spiritual dreams and here is one of them.\nI dreamed that one night I was traveling on a road with wooded areas on both sides when I ran out of gas and I had to pull over and walk up a hill where a service station was open and it would take me approx. 30 mins. to walk to the service station from my vehicle.\nalong the way I saw what looked like a black panther stalking me and just as soon as this black cat was fixing to attack me a white wolf starting howling and when it did that a large pack of other white wolves came out of the woods and consumed the huge black cat that was stalking me and the white wolf that howled walked with me up to the service station and when I got there and looked back the white wolf was gone and my dream ended and I woke up.,the road is the path you are on in life, the wooded areas are the snares and brambles, troubles and temptations that are around you..you ran out of gas which means spiritually you were to a point that you were drained, and couldn't go forward in the vehicle that you had made it that far in...that vehicle could be a specific church, or a doctrine from a church, maybe even another religion...the hill is the battle to find the truth of GOD...the perception of time that it takes to get to the service station symbolizes the amount of time totally that you have spent seeking and pushing forward...there may have been times that you sought, then stopped seeking, then started again...the black panther stalking you was the enemy-he thought by isolating you that you were unprotected..the fact that the Alpha wolf howled was a call to the warrior angelic host to intervene and keep you from the claws of the enemy...JESUS walks with us, protects us and leads us back to the power source, FATHER GOD.

__label__10 , Should we be able to protect our medicinal cannabis rights under the First Amendment ?,Growing your own medicine can save you money, working with your own plants can be peaceful and relaxing. Yet every October when our medicinal crops are about ready for harvest, the rippers come, theives in the night stealing our medicine for illegal purposes. Yet by law we are not allowed to have a firearem on the premises to protect our medicine from getting in the hands of unlawful street pushers.  It is illegal for us to protect our property from theives and to help keep our medicine where it belongs, with the patient whom it is prescribed to.  How are we suppose to do our part in keeping cannabis off the streets when we can't by law have a firearm at the same location as we cultivate our medicine when so many theives that make a nightly job out of stalking and robbing our gardens are usually more armed then the local police department? Is it fair to not be able to protect our rights that we the California people voted for and protect out crops as we would protect our homes?,my pursuit of happiness includes cannibas, as did Washington's, Jefferson's and most americans through the first 125 years or so of our republic, right up to Hemp for Victory the WW2 era propaganda film ENCOURAGING every farmer to grow hemp as their patriotic duty.\nlately the morality police have made a big business of crime and prison building, its a multibillion dollar racket and it explains a lot of illogical things the government does to stamp out a plant.\nsomeone with free and easy access to hemp would invent a process to make your own ethanol in your garage and we would start being self-sufficient, a big no-no in a consumer society like ours.\nnow you know.

__label__2 , Why does the moon have something to do with high and low tides?,,The force (gravity) the moon exerts on the Earth morphs the shape of the entire planet by pulling up on it.  Since the particles that comprise the Earth have mass the gravity acts on them, drawing them towards its source (the center of mass/center of the moon here).\n\nWater, being fluid, moves more readily than other things like the hard rock that makes up the land masses of the Earth so it seems to be more affected by the moon's gravity.  When the moon is overhead it pulls the water (and less noticably everything else) towards it, creating a high tide (as well as one on the opposite side of the planet).  The sun also affects the tides to a lesser degree.

Whatever that might be for you... a warm bath, a hot cup of tea, reading a book... \n\nIf you lie there awake when you go to bed, occupy your mind in a non distressing way. Recite a childhood fairytale such as the 3 Bears... and when your mind starts to wander to everyday worries, pull it firmly back to the story... you'll fall asleep before you get past the porridge!

What amp do you recomend?,,marshall stacks are very overrated. they haven't done anything to make marshalls better in 40 years. the clean channel sounds dirty and the amps own distortion is muddy. \nthe SG standard is fun guitar to play. depending on your sound..........any fender tube amp will make it sound great. twin reverb is one of the best amps ever built. if you can afford one, get a mesa boogie. a one twelve combo is as loud as any four twelve stack. plus you'd be micking it up anyway on stage. mesa's are so versatile, you can achieve any sounds from them, whether you play country twang or black metal. they are perfect. but you can get that two twelve fender combo for under 800 used. whatever you do, don't buy a solid state amp. even those peavey trans tubes are garbage. i made the mistake of buying one years ago. stick with tubes. especially with those warm hums on the sg. the SG is so thin, you really don't get any resonation from the guitar's wood body. the sound you get is very dependent on your amp with that guitar. it's just strings to pickups to amp. alot of thicker body guitars get a thicker tone because they share some acoustic characteristics. SGs don't get that at all. but what you lose there, you win with the light body, great natural trem, (just shake the guitar around a little bit when you play). and kick butt sound.

__label__2 , What do the names mean in the Sword Of Moses?,http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sword.htm\nWhat does it have to do with the names?\nP.S If you think this has nothing to do with science its in the subject of 1Oth Century Arcane Science.,they most likely mean nothing. This appears to be one of many heretical documents created during the reign of THeospacy in England. Since many of the documents were formed by the process of 'ghost writing' (relying on spritual impulses or dreams to form content) random infomration can appear more significant than intended.\n\n-Intresting note: SOme of the names have been changed from the orginal document, according to the footnotes, based on further 'translation' of the heavenly language. It would appear that the names are suppose to have meaning in the language of 'heaven' which some teoshpists and today's new-agers belive would give them mystic power if they could learn to speak it.

__label__2 , Rocket Science?,Hydrazine, N2H4 , and its derivatives are widely used as rocket fuels. The combustion of hydrazine with oxygen produces N2 (g) and H2O (g). When 1.90 grams of hydrazine is burned in a bomb calorimeter, the temperature of the calorimeter rises by 4.20oC. The calorimeter contains 925.0 g of water, and the bomb has a heat capacity of 887.0 J/K. What is the heat of reaction in KJ/mol for the combustion of one mole of hydrazine?,I searched through my thermodynamics book for this, so I hope you appreciate it.\nFirst, you need a ballanced chemical equation.\n\n2N2H2 + O2 ---> 2H2O + 2N2\n\nC = 887.0 J/K = 0.8870 kJ/ K\nn = 1 mol (since it's a 2 to 2 relation, we can just say 1)\ndelta T = T = 4.20 ºC = 4.20 K\nq = ?\n\nq = CT/n = (0.8870 kJ/K * 4.20 K) / (1 mol) \n  =  3.73 kJ/mol\n\n\nHope this helps!

__label__7 , Hi everyone! I want to know how to increase traffic to my website! How do i make my add appear in search engin,Hi everyone! I want to know how to increase traffic to my website! How do i make my add appear in search engine for free!\n\nAll of them! \nGoogle\nYahoo\nMsn\nLycos\nAOl\nAlivtsa\netc , etc...\n\nI want to drive as much traffic to my website free of charge, what other ways are there?\n\nThanks all.\n\nIts not quite finished yet, be ready by the end of the night.\nwww.hexham.mobi,You can try pay per click programs such as Google Adwords http://www.google.com/adwords or Yahoo Search Marketing http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com – though the key is to carefully track your ROI and which keywords actually perform well\n\nHere are some shoestring marketing ideas that can help you get the visitors you need at the least cost possible: \n\n1. Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!\n\nRecommend Site Scripts (various) http://php.resourceindex.com/Complete_Scripts/Website_Promotion/Recommend_Site/\nBig Nose Bird Recommend this Site http://bignosebird.com/carchive/birdcast.shtml \nCGI Resource Index http://cgi.resourceindex.com/Programs_and_Scripts/Perl/Website_Promotion/Recommend_Site/\nHostscripts http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Scripts_and_Programs/Site_Recommendation/index.html\n\n3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\nIf you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day. http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm \n\n4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. \n\nhttp://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html\nhttp://i-newswire.com/\nhttp://www.24-7pressrelease.com/\nhttp://www.pressbox.co.uk/cgi-bin/links/add.cgi\nhttp://www.pr.com/press-releases\nhttp://www.prfree.com/\nhttp://www.clickpress.com/releases/index.shtml\nhttp://www.theopenpress.com/\nhttp://www.przoom.com/\nhttp://www.prweb.com\nhttp://www.newswiretoday.com/\nhttp://www.free-press-release.com/\n\n5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. If 50 websites publish your article and it contains a link back to your website, then you easily get 50 links from a single article. The more links you have, the greater your chances for increasing your search engine rankings.\n\nHere is a comprehensive list of where to submit your articles http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=AhzreGmnCUicOoyedqypscUjzKIX?qid=1006022407481\n\n6. Post a link to your site for free where it is allowed (always read the Terms of Use).

__label__3 , Have you ever stopped going to a particular doctor because his/her office staff screws up your billing?,I seem to have  bad luck in this dept.I went to a Dr, thought my insurance was going to cover the whole visit, they only covered half, I didint realize it, never got a bill for the other half, and then after only a month the billing dept sends me to collections!! I also had another Doc's office staff send my name to a collection agency when I didint owe anything! Now, another doc'c office has just sent me a bill for an office visit of almost 2 years ago, insisiting that I pay it.I stopped going to those other 2 doctors.I would really like to fight the bill I just got,You should clarify your insurance coverage and a doctor's billing policy before being seen.  If you have billing problems with an office discuss it with the office manager, and if it cannot be resolved change doctor's.  If you contest a bill the vast majority of doctors will make a compromise - and if they will not - it is just as well that you are no longer a patient.

One of the first things that Ford Prefect did for Arthur Dent after the demolition of the Earth was to equip him with a towel.\n\nThey can be used for snaring birds whilst falling from a three-mile high marble statue.\n\nThey can be used to signal temporally unstable spaceships by fossilizing them in planetary strata.\n\nThey can be soaked in nutrients to provide sustenance in awkward situations (Although, as Zaphod Beeblebrox found, this is not a terribly tasty solution to hunger).\n\nThey can also do a really good job of drying between your toes.\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide is full of suggestions for successful towel deployment. It is worth noting that a cup of white vinegar in a wash will help keep your towels fluffy and soft.\n\nIn other words, they are the NEW Swiss Army Knife!!!

__label__7 , What approaches a business firm could use to gather information about competion and evaluate them?,,Obviously the web is a great place to start, look through their website, and do a search on the company to see if there are any articles or press on them. A very common, but sneaky way is to have a friend or associate pretend to be a potential customer and have them ask all of the questions you want to learn. Be careful with this method, do not ask any questions that are outside of the standard questions that your customers ask you.

My father is a healthy older man, but he uses a cell phone all the time, and stores it on his belt and got both prostate cancer, and cancer of the scalp.  Coincidence?  I doubt it.  I can feel the radiation going through my head every time I use one.  The fact that science can't put 2+2 together just says that scientific researchers are idiots, not that cell phones don't cause cancer.\n\nBy the time they realize the damage it does to cells, it'll be too late to take back all those years of people's lives.
__label__6 , Who started the tradition of pitchers not stepping on  the infield foul line?,,It's not really a tradition so much as a superstition.

I did the same thing when I played ball in highschool and college and I do the same thing now when I play rec league softball.

The green cape is both another pointer to the same confusion, but this time re to earth sciences, and a reminder that a great effort is called for – a cape is typical super-hero attire.\n\nThe golden shoes are allusions to how much has been invested in resources, time and effort in education - and yet these dunderheads grow more ignorant and blind. (Hence the 2 sets of spectacles). \n\nHe is also telling me to expose their anti-scientific approach as lies. This is why he has a crocodile’s tail, which is obviously a metaphor for “their tale is a croc.”\n\nThe white mustache is yet another attempt by Him to get me to appreciate Salvador Dali. On this I am a heretic\n\nWith this gaudy get-up, I can only assume it's a Bonobo chimp. And that would be a whole messsage unto itself.

For example if it is a music channel you can advertise it in music magazines and sites.\n\nYou need to disclosure more information about your TV channel to get better answers…\n\nGenerally, I suggest you advertise it in newspapers, magazines, and billboards (not radio).\nIf TV channels in your region or country are plenty you may need to segment the market you are targeting at, so that you are differentiated (creating advantages and adding value for your clients).\n\nDo market research… See how your idea sounds to people? Listen to what they need… you may get proposals on what type of channel is missing in your town or what type of channel they want.\n\nBear in mind that a TV channel is a big investment and you need to carefully plan all your steps and actions.

But when I tried to sms the ring tone it was received just as an ordinary sms.  Need Help,The key to this problem depends much on the type of your mobile phone.\nA plain SMS is just a text message. To attach something to a message, you need to send an EMS (E for Extended) or a multimedia message (MMS). \nAn EMS is basically an SMS (160 bytes at most, usually) that embodies simple black-and-white images or ringtones.\nIn MMS-es you can attach one or more images or ringtones (MIDI or WAV) to a text message.\nIf the phone model allows it, you can purchase a USB data cable to transfer data to/from the PC, or you can use wireless technologies, including IrDA and Bluetooth (the PC must be equipped with an appropriate adapter).

The funny thing is, was that Buddha was just an ordinary man and said the same things 500 years before the so called son of God arrived.,yes, pretty much.... and the jesus and tree of life must have been plagiarized from greek and scandinavian mythology respectively.
__label__1 , If you Love something(someone) let it go if it comes back to you it was ment to be?

If someone feels trapped they will often build resentment and sabotage the relationship to get out. It has to be a mutual choice.
__label__3 , Do you think its right for a mom to take her 2 yr old to a psychiatrist?,I know someone who has been going to one for many years.  She has depression problems, and some other mental health issues.  She started taking her daughter when she was only 2 yrs old?  Does anyone else think that is odd?,A 2 year old child, and indeed a 4 year old child, is a metaphorical sponge. Unless there has been a trauma, a valid set of symptoms, or some other REALLY good reason for taking a 2 year old to a psych., then I'm afraid that all it will do is suggest to the child that all problems can be solved by a doc and a pill. Not a healthy approach to raising a child to be an autonomous adult. As for inheriting the problems of the mother, these problems are not likely to be diagnosed in a small child ( most inherited depression will show up in older children or adolescents), and if such concerns exist, attentive parenting will tell when the child is in need of professional help. And, if the child is in distress via the environment created by a depressed mother, then the main focus should be to prevent the mother's parenting from hurting the child, rather than treating the child for the damage her mother's parenting is causing.

__label__10 , Is Affirmative action extortion?,Why does it only apply to certain groups?  Please do not reply unless affirmative action does NOT apply to you.,Affirmative action applies to everyone.

It basically tells them that they are worthless and could never get anywhere in life if certain special exemptions weren't made for them.

__label__10 , Why did the Germans decide to invade poland in the second WW?,Who was behind there decision?,Who was behind it? All the power hungry psychopaths that liked Hitler´s ideas of course. \n\nThere also was a secret part to the Hitler-Stalin-pact that came into place after the german invasion from the west - the red army came from the east and forced the polish government into fleeing to Rumania. Shortly after that Poland was divided between the two forces. \n\nWhat was behind it was simple - Hitler wrote in his book Mein Kampf that either Germany would be worldleaders or would not be at all.... so world domination was the foremost reason behind it. \nClever enough, german SS forces dressed up as polish freedomfighters and attacked the german radiostation in Gleiwitz near the polish border and declared war with Germany while posing as polish forces. With this one and a couple of other attacks they tried to justify attacking Poland shortly after. \n\nBTW, it is not true that Germany had no colonies, actually St. Thomas was a German colony (now US) just like Crab Island in the caribbean and Ghana used to be Groß Friedrichsburg. Those days were gone in the 1930s but yes, Germany had colonies.

__label__5 , can i use my wife's car navigation to track her where abouts....she drives  an acura TL?,,I'm going to forego the assumption that everyone else has made regarding the status of your marriage and simply answer your question.\n\nThe short answer is no, there isn't currently a way to track your wife through your Acura TL navigation system.  However, several cellular phone companies offer GPS and for $9.99/mo. you can locate a cell phone user through services such as Family Locator through Sprint,  Xora, eTrace and other applications through Nextel; and I'm sure other carriers are offering something similar.\n\nAs an aside, vehicles equipped with OBDIII (On-Board Diagnostics 3) have GPS tracking systems integrated into your cars ECM which will allow government agencies to track your location, speed, and even get updated data about the condition of your car (last time you had it serviced, for example).  With this technology they will be able to issue you a speeding ticket without even seeing you, or shut-down your car remotely if you don't pay your overdue parking tickets, etc.  The latest Chevy Corvette already has it.

__label__10 , Is democracy an acceptable form of government throughout the world?,Maybe Islam doesn't allow for freedom. I see women treated very differently then men in Muslim countires and maybe it's impossible to have freedom of different kinds in certain cultures. Maybe women like to be oppresssed and enslaved in certain circumstances. Maybe men do. Serbs, Tutsies etc. have killed there neighbors endlessly. How long was the Iraq/Iran war? Didn't they have children clear mine fields by walking in them? Maybe we can only live under a benevolent dictator,No, it just doesn't work in some cultures. Look at the former USSR... the Communist Party is coming back stronger than ever and it's because Democracy in Russia has put so many people into the streets and the Russian mobsters have taken over just about everything over there including many top positions in Government. Many Russians have been protesting to have the Communist's put back into power. For the last year or so, Russians have had to do something they have not had to do before...They now have to pay their own utility bills. Now they have to pay for water, gas and electricity. \n\nI feel that Socialism and Democracy can work well together if implemented correctly. You can have a Socialist Government and still have Freedom. \n\nThat form of Government should be put into practice here in the USA. I don't know about you but I am tired of having 5% of the people here in the USA controling 95% of the wealth!\n\nPower should never be allowed to be in the hands of one person!\n\nMany Americans don't see it yet but in the last decade, we have been losing some of our freedoms! (Think about it).\n\nWomen should be treated as equals all over the world. I believe that day will come.\n\nBy the way, the Iran/Iraq War lasted from 1980 - 1988.

__label__6 , 3 UT Football players where arrested for Underage consuming, and other charges.?,I was listening on local radio and they where talking about what to do.  Many where more worried about the Football teams playing than the fact that they: 1) Broke team rules, and  2) Broke the law.\nNot one word is being mentioned about the business selling to them (Why where they not carded in the 1st place?  Becaseu they where players at THEIR place-in other owords good for business after a game?)  And one person on the radio actually said leave them alone, they are black and disadvantage enough as it is, that if they got kicked off the team it would destroy their future.\n\nMy Question is:  1)  Should they be treated differently becasue they are football players?  2)  Should they be kicked off the team for it.  and 3)  Shouldn't they also be focusing on the bar, even if it is a well to do business.,1 Yes punishment should be added, they should be punished athletically not just as people breaking a law. Oh you mean agreeing with the idiots and that I don't agree to. Sounds like you were listening to racists as hosts who think they are trying to do a favor.\n2. Proably not because face it you aren't going to see a guy excpelled from college for it. They should be punished and suspended from the team for a week or more.\n3. The bar should be punished but likely was in a college town and having been in those towns they don't always ID on Saturday nights. At least ones I've been to. I don't know maybe I looked old enough and my friends did but I think it is just what they do. Is it wrong? Sure, but it's buisness.

__label__4 , Help to check my essay, please?,This is a comment on Peter Carey's The Rose.\nrefer to: http://spaces.msn.com/xatom,(I have not read Peter Carey's The Rose...)\n\nYour story is very good, and I hope I’m not too late to have a look at it.  (I thought there might be others who would want to have a go at editing it before me!)\n\nI hope I have got the gist of it correctly; do you actually mean “glasshouse”, or would “greenhouse” be better all the way through?  In the UK we would normally use “greenhouse”.\n\nWell, here is how I would say it – just a few minor corrections:\n\nThe story is about how a former Commandant of Auschwitz hid himself in an isolated mountain village, passing his days by growing a black rose, (would you put, instead, “passing his days by growing a black rose, in fear of his fate….?) and his fate of being captured by the government.  The story is set in a poor Mediterranean town twenty-five years after World War II.  The former Nazi Commandant turned into an old man who made (a helmet while living in a shabby room/home/ house?  Not clear!)  He was afraid that the locals would identify him as a demon (try “criminal”, or “war criminal”), so he lived a simple life by growing roses.  As the town was (I would keep the tenses consistent) rural, aliens (or, more colloquially, “newcomers”?) were not very welcome, even though the old man (had?) lived there for twenty-five years.  In the story, there are contradictions between repentance and forgiveness; fear and hope; awe and fortune.\n\nThe settings of the story are rather vague.\n\nThe reader can only infer that the place is an isolated mountain village in which the locals spoke Spanish very badly.  It seems that the place is somewhere in the Mediterranean.  There are only about two sentences implying where it is: “I have looked for the village in an atlas and cannot find it”; “He spoke Spanish very badly”.  Such a vague description of place creates an atmosphere of loneliness that reflects the old man’s life.\n\nThe time is precise in detail but vague as a whole.  The author does not imply the exact time when the old man arrived in the town, but just says: “after twenty-five years”.  This shows that the longer the old man stayed there, the more horrified he felt.  In the story, the clock the old man sent to the school as a gift stopped, and “its hands were still showing eighteen minutes past seven when two more foreigners arrived in the village fifteen years afterwards”.  The description of the precise time shows the destiny of the old man while the author does not give the exact time.  The time is just a symbol.\n\nSymbolization is the most important feature of the story.\n\nThe old man planted roses and nurtured a tremendously large, black rose.  Roses are ancient symbols of love and beauty.  In the story, the black rose has its own special symbolic meaning, analysing it by its context.  First, as a true black rose is impossible to produce naturally, to grow one represents slavish devotion.  The old man put all his time and energy into growing roses in an intricately-wrought glasshouse, so that he produced a black rose twice the size of a man’s fist.  Black roses in subculture mean tragedy.  At the end of the story, the old man was captured/caught as a war criminal.  In addition, the black rose might denote shame and dishonour.  Why was the old man willing to be teased by the idle clerk?  Why did the old man look fragile and pitiful?  Maybe he felt shame for what he had done before in his life.  He might have wanted to atone for his crime by growing roses.  Furthermore, the black rose might symbolize the dark side of a person.  The old man knew that being captured was his destiny, no matter how he concealed his past, but the instinct of survival motivated him to take the chance.  Finally, the black rose in the story has an implication of hope of life.  The black rose was left while the old man was taken away, and its descendants were carefully nurtured by the locals.  They, in turn, show complex feelings towa

__label__2 , What is an Erlang?,,The dimensionless unit named the erlang is a statistical measure of telecommunications traffic used in telephony. It is named after the Danish telephone engineer A. K. Erlang, the originator of traffic engineering and queueing theory.\n\nIn the traffic calculation, one Erlang implies a single resource in continuous use (or two channels at fifty percent use, and so on, pro rata). For example, if a bank has two tellers and they are both busy the whole time, that would represent two erlang of traffic.\n\nThe traffic measured in erlang is used to determine if a system is over- or under-provisioned (has too many or too few resources allocated).\n\nThe traffic measured over many busy hours might be used for a T1 or E1 circuit group to determine how many voice lines are in use at the busiest hours. For example, if no more than 12 out of 24 channels are ever in use at any given time, the other 12 might be made available as data channels.\n\nTraffic measured in erlang is used to calculate grade of service (GoS) or quality of service (QoS).\n\nThere are a range of different Erlang formulae, including Erlang B, Extended Erlang B, Erlang C and a related Engset formula to calculate GoS

__label__1 , Masturbation?,Why do so many religions think that masturbation is wrong? espessially for women. The body is a temple and should be loved by ourselves and our mate, what is the problem?,The answers goes back many centuries.  In the past there was a  HUGE risk of miscarriage and death during birth due to poor medical practies.  Due to this birth rates were very low and there was a legitimate threat of a society dying out.  Religion, then, as it does now, attempted to fix a societal problem by outlawing masturbation in the hope that if they outlawed masturbation people would be more interested in the opposite sex, would have more sex, and hence create more babies, alleviating the concern that a population crisis (too few) would ensue.

__label__8 ,  Munich  ; the movie . Is that realy , what happend in the seventies ?,I mean the agents in this movie kill , distroy , move from a country to another ; and no one care about them!,Operation Wrath of God and Operation Spring of Youth\n\nGolda Meir and the Israeli Defense Committee made a decision secretly authorizing the Mossad to track down and eliminate those responsible for the Munich massacre [25]. To this end the Mossad set up a number of special teams to locate and eliminate these terrorists, aided by the agency's stations in Europe [26].\n\nThe Israeli mission later became known as Operation Wrath of God or Mivtza Elohim[27]. Reeve quotes General Aharon Yariv — who, he writes, was the general overseer of the operation — as stating that after Munich the Israeli government felt it had no alternative but to exact justice.\n\n    We had no choice. We had to make them stop, and there was no other way ... we are not very proud about it. But it was a question of sheer necessity. We went back to the old biblical rule of an eye for an eye ... I approach these problems not from a moral point of view, but, hard as it may sound, from a cost-benefit point of view. If I’m very hard-headed, I can say, what is the political benefit in killing this person? Will it bring us nearer to peace? Will it bring us nearer to an understanding with the Palestinians or not? In most cases I don’t think it will. But in the case of Black September we had no other choice and it worked. Is it morally acceptable? One can debate that question. Is it politically vital? It was.[28]\n\nBenny Morris writes that, using information from turned PLO personnel and friendly European intelligence services, the Mossad compiled its target list, placing at the top Wael 'Aadel Zwaiter, a suspected member of Black September and the official PLO representative in Italy, who was shot and killed on October 16. Abu Iyad, the PLO's deputy-chief and chief of intelligence until his death at the hands of an Abu Nidal operative in 1991, later claimed that Zwaiter was not connected to Black September and had fiercely opposed ... all forms of terrorism (Abu Iyad 1983). Zwaiter's death was followed by non-fatal letter bomb attacks on PLO representatives in Algeria and Libya, on Palestinians in Bonn and Copenhagen, and on a Red Cross representative in Stockholm, writes Morris.\n\nOn December 8, the PLO's representative in Paris, Mohammad Hamshari was killed by a radio-detonated bomb under his desk. Over the next three months, writes Morris, four PLO, PFLP, and PFLP-GC operatives were killed in Cyprus, Greece, and Paris.\n\nOn April 9, 1973, Israel launched Operation Spring of Youth, a joint Mossad-IDF operation in Beirut. The targets were Mohammad Yusuf al-Najjar (Abu Yusuf), head of Fatah's intelligence arm, which ran Black September, according to Morris; Kamal Adwan, who headed the PLO's so-called Western Sector, which controlled PLO action inside Israel; and Kamal Nassir, the PLO spokesman. A group of Sayeret commandos were taken in nine missile boats and a small fleet of patrol boats to a deserted Lebanese beach, before driving in two cars to downtown Beirut, where they killed Najjar, Adwan and Nassir. Two further detachments of commandos blew up the PFLP's headquarters in Beirut and a Fatah explosives plant. The leader of the commando team that conducted the operations was Ehud Barak.\n\nOn June 28, 1973, the Algerian-born director of operations for Black September in Europe, Mohammad Boudia, was killed by a car bomb in Paris.\n\nOn July 21, 1973, in the so-called Lillehammer affair, a team of Mossad agents killed Ahmed Bouchiki, a Moroccan man unrelated to the Munich attack, in Lillehammer, Norway, after an informant mistakenly said Bouchiki was Ali Hassan Salameh, the head of Force 17 and a Black September operative. Five Mossad agents, including two women, were captured by the Norwegian authorities, while others managed to slip away[29]. The five were convicted of the killing and imprisoned, but were released and returned to Israel in 1975.\n\nThe Mossad later found Ali Hassan Salameh in Be

__label__4 , I live in New York City and want to move to Georgia to obtain My Bachelors what is there to do in Atlanta?,I am graduating next year '07 with my associates degree and next fall planning on moving to ATlanta,Georgia to obtain my Bachelors. I will be in a new state and wanna how may stay may be like. What is there to do besides clubbing in Georgia and specifically Atlanta? Please leave detailed descriptions. virtual hugs:),I'm from the Atlanta area and went to school in New York City, so I might be able to help a little. First off, I don't like Atlanta much at all. You can't really walk around, there's way too much traffic, and it's miserable in the summer.\n\nHowever, going to school here might be different because there is a lot of opportunity to do athletic-type activities, if you are so inclined, and you'll make friends quickly. The food is excellent in Atlanta. All kinds, all kinds of price ranges, all kinds of decor. I actually like eating in Atlanta more than I did in New York. While the arts scene is definitely not up to New York's standards, the acting community here is really good, so the theatrical productions, while sparse, are usually fun to see. Movies open here a week or two later than New York (or not at all). There are two art film houses (kind of) and the museum has a film schedule. The music scene is kind of onverwhelming at first, but try as many places as you can and you'll figure it out. One thing Atlanta has that may sound a little juvenile but I love it is the Center for Puppetry Arts (puppet shows). Don't laugh, just try it. The mountains are less than two hours away; Charleston is a good romantic weekend trip...\n\nAs for walking around, there is Piedmont Park and local festivals, but it's really rather bleak in that regard. If you live in Roswell or Alpharetta (north side) there are many parks there.\n\nInside Atlanta, there is a tiny hippie strip called Little Five Points that is kind of like St. Marks. Close by is the Highlands which is kind of nice. East Atlanta is close by and is kind of the indie-rock part of town, I guess. All of these areas you can walk places and won't need to drive everywhere.\n\nJakes Ice Cream!\n\nI'm not a clubbing person, so I'm no help there. I don't like Buckhead much at all.\n\nCheck out Creative Loafing... (web site below)\n\nGood luck, and an early welcome to Georgia!

__label__8 , Illegal fisherman?,There was a rumor that a Louisiana man was fishing illegally, catching many fish, but he would not ever get caught at it.  So one day, a new game warden, also new to the territory, decided to catch this man at his game, and he went to where the man usually fished.  Dressing like an ordinary fisherman, and carrying his fishing pole, he approached the man and asked if he could go fishing with him. The man looked him over, and then said, sure, why not.\nSo they got into a small row boat and rowed out into the middle of the lake.  After a couple of hours of regular fishing, the man decided that the new guy was okay, so he pulls out some dynamite and proceeds to lite it.\n\nThe young game warden immediately says to the man, “Mister, I am the new  game warden and you are under arrest for illegal fishing.”\n\nThe man, holding the lit dynamite, hands it to the game warden, and says, “ you gonna fish or talk?”,LOL!!   Amazing how quickly our values change when holding a stick of dynamite!!

I've cleaned under the fridge the drian overflowes EVERYTHING, I've fogged the house yet they're still here.  Does anyone have any suggestions?,I'm sure you're aware that you have to find their breeding site. Once the site is found it must be thoroughly scraped, cleaned, and dried. \n\nThe locations vary widely, but are usually associated with rotting fruit, vegetables or meat, wet organic soil, potted plants, cut flowers, garbage disposals, pet cages and floor drains. \n\nLarge infestations of these flies are often the result of broken drains or garbage disposals that allow organic matter to accumulate in out-of-the-way places such as wall voids, under floors, in basements, or in the soil of crawl spaces. Phorid flies often serve as an indicator of a broken sewage line. As organic-rich waste-water passes through a damaged line, some of the solution seeps into surrounding soil. This can provide the perfect breeding ground for phorid flies. If you have an ongoing phorid fly problem, consider having the sewage lines inspected for leaks and repaired as needed

Now it has popped off again, and I still can't get it back on.  Any suggestions to an easy way to put it back on??,as a pierced person and a former body piercer i might be able to help. first off there are to dimples on a captive ring ball, while standing in front of a mirror so you can see what you're doing, seat one of the dimples one the lower portion of the ring and press inward . if you hear it click you've got it in. there is also a possibility that the ring itself is slightly stretched more then it should be causing the ball to not sit properly. you may have to go back to a tattoo shop and have them close the ring down some then reinsert the ball. if the ball spins freely when in position then you may want to have it tightened so it won't come out so easily.

__label__4 , Statistic Regression Project Ideas?,Hi I am a student currently in Elementary Statistics and I was assigned A Regression statistics project, I was wondering if anyone could give me some ideas on what do do my project on as a sample? something unique but not into depth?,You want something where there is a linear relationship and data are easy to get.\n\nAn easy choice would be to use stock data.  Regrss the returns of a particular stock against the returns of the S&P 500.   You can find the data on Yahoo! Finance (take raw prices -- divide each price by the previous price and subtract one to get the returns).  While this wiould be easy to get, it would not be unique -- lots of people do this.\n\nSomething that might be fun might involve regressing some characteristic of a city against the population.  \n\nHere is my idea:  Find 15 big cities, 15 medium sized cities and 15 small towns.  Get the population of each city.  Then find some statistic for each city.  Perhaps it is the number of homes with internet connectins, perhaps it is the number of felonies, perhaps it is the number of people with AIDs or some other disease, perhaps it is the number of universities nearbye.  Then do a regression of that statistic to see if the size of the city is a significant predictor of that statistic.\n\nYou need to be careful -- I suspect some of these are related to size but not in a linear way.  For example AIDs cases are probably related to size but not linear -- since many AIDs cases in small towns probably moved.  Similarly, rape or burglary are probably more likely to be linearly related than murder.  For those that aren't linear, you might try regressing LN(statistic).\n\nGood luck

We dont really talk at school but thats because we never see eachother except in the halls sometimes. We hung out on friday at the ymca, but we both brought another person so he played basketball and me and my friend exercised and play ping pong and air hockey and while we were playing air hockey he came up to me and talked while I played. Hes kinda shy so usually I start the conversations and then we both start talking but at the Ymca he came up to me and hes the one that got me into the ymca, I was one of his guests. I like him ALOT. When I walked into the Ymca and saw him waiting for me at the front desk my hands started shaking. Do you guys know any signs he will show if he likes me? Hes kind of shy like I already mentioned if that helps. Thanks so much =],Obviously he is feeling something if he invited you and then made an effort to talk to you. Give it time and don't rush it. He will start to feel comfortable around you and let you know exactly how he feels. If he is still shy, then you come out and ask him. Don't be scared of what he might say because it is better to know than to never know.

__label__3 , How do I get rid of a life-long bad habit?,I've had a bad habit for like 20 years.  Is there any hope of kicking it?  It's something I do like 3-4 times a week to help me relax.,First off, believe that you CAN kick the habit.  Whatever the case may be, believing in yourself is KEY.  Confidence in yourself is also very important. \n\nIdentify the reason you do it OTHER than it relaxes you, because quite frankly, (like my smoking) that is an excuse and an excuse only, not a reason.\n\nGet rid of the reason, stress, depression, whatever it is.\n\nDevelop a support system.  Weather it be friends, family, therapy or an Internet group and sometimes even your family doctor.\n\nThen finally, follow through.  Find something that distracts you.  Something you can do EVERY time you are tempted.  It could be a hand held game (like the poker ones or something) crossword puzzles, anything that stimulates thought.  It would be great if you had someone you could call or email or like I said an Internet group you could write ANYTIME Internet was available.

__label__8 , How do I clean a scratched dsc?,I have an Xbox game disc that got scratched thanks to 3 yo and a computer game disc that is also scratched.  I've tried the vasoline trick and that didn't work.,CDs get a lot of scratches overtime.  I see you have tried the vaseline trick.  Did you try the toothpaste? howabout wipe off?  Let me post it for you in case you haven't:\n\nSquirt toothpaste around the scatched CD. \n\nTake the face cloth (or towel) and wipe the tooth paste (don't use the clear gel type) around. Use a circular pattern, don't rub too hard, but work the scratched area over well, and then wipe it off. Wipe from the centre of the disc to the outer edges to prevent further damage to the disc. \n\nAfter all toothpaste is gone you're good to go. \n\nRepeat steps 2 and 3 if necessary. \n\nThis doesn't always work but it should make a difference. Scratches will be there but it won't skip anymore.\n\nHope I was of help.

__label__1 , Is LDS Christian?,because i heard that in the LDS religion that there is an idea that humans can acheive god like status which is definantly not christian,No. If one claimed to be a Mormon but denied all the basic tenets of Mormonism — that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, that the Book of Mormon is true and divinely inspired, that god was once a man who progressed to godhood through keeping the laws and ordinances of the Mormon Church, and that the Mormon Church was divinely established — the Mormon Church would reject such a person’s claim to being a Latter-day Saint. One cannot fairly call oneself a Mormon if one does not believe the fundamental doctrines taught by the Mormon Church. By the same token, if the Mormon Church does not hold to even the basic biblical truths believed by the greater Christian community down through the ages, how can Christians reasonably be expected to accept Mormonism as authentic Christianity?

Every year, dozens of foreigners pay fines and are put in Immigration detention for breaking the law.

When I started to sweat heavily, I would exit the sauna and take a quick shower... rinsing the sweat off of me.  \n\nI would then return to the sauna and repeat the procedure until I had drank all the water.\n\nI felt great!  That first day went fairly easily.  The next day was pure torture.  I think I sweated out all the nicotine that first day and had massive withdrawels on the second.

__label__9 , Did she really steal?,One of my best friends has been staying at my house for over three months now because she got kicked out of her home. We share the same room and all and technically she is allowed to borrow my stuff, but she usually asks. Except this one time. I had just bought this skirt and never worn it. I came up one day, trying to find it and asked my family if theyve seen it. They said she had left with it. Here's the thing, when someone confronted her about it her excuse was that it was a joke. It's been a week and she never gave it back. I havent really seen her around because she's been at her bf and all. Alot of people have been telling me she stole. And that the joke part was really just a coverup because i tend to forgive easily. Many of my friends said you''re too nice and naive, you let people walk all over you and you cant get mad when you should be bad. Is it possible that she might have stole and lied to me? What am I suppose to do?,Just a joke often means somebody covering themselves. In this case it doesn't sound like a joke.  \n\nBut covering themselves doesn't necessarily mean she stole it.  She may have felt that she had your permission to borrow things, as you implied.  So if somebody confronted her about something she borrowed, her automatic response may well have been to become defensive and conver herself.  \n\nI'm a little confused about her not returning, though.  You share a bedroom.  Do you share dressers and closets?  If she has her own set of clothes and stores it there, why not just take it back?  Surely she hasn't been WEARING it for the past two weeks.  \n\nTalk to her about it, but don't accuse her.  If she felt she was allowed to borrow your stuff freely, it's not fair to accuse her of stealing simply because you hadn't worn the skirt yet, especially if she didn't know it was brand new or special.\n\nGood luck.

__label__2 , can someone explain alternating current generation and distribution on aircraft?,this answer should be easy enough for an apprentice to understand,I am an old air craft engine mechanic so things may be a little different now.\nThey use an alternator to generate the AC voltage for the aircraft.\nThe alternator on your car produces AC current and with the use of diodes changes it to DC.\nThe reason for using AC is that the voltage can be changed very easily with a transformer and with a diode to DC to operate just about any kind of electonics.

We don't really fit in on the Earth, and our presence is destroying it. \n\nOne thing that you must admit -- that we might have been dropped off by aliens is just as, or more, believeable than the other fairy tales on creation.,I would say that this is against both evolution and creationism.  \n\nIf humans were not from earth then why would we have so many similar internal organs to other animals?  I mean I doubt any extraterrestrial creature could have a pig's heart transplanted into their body like humans can.\n\nIt could be that humans were in some way altered by aliens or our culture is influenced by aliens.  But this lacks any real evidence at present and is thus a very unlikly (but not impossible) case.\n\nPersonally I think there are aliens of some sort but they are not amongst us in any conventional sense at the moment.
__label__2 , Why are saltwater fish not salty tasting?,What is the chemical/biological process of saltwater fish that makes them unsalty?  What's the chemistry that makes this synthesis happen?  I'm guessing part of it starts with plankton and algae down the food chain.  But there still must be some processes that fish have that makes them not be salty.,Most vertebrates have their own internal milieu, that is, we maintain constant concentrations of ions and water that are different from those of the environment. This is achieved by means of the osmoregulatory system, which includes the kidneys but also, in the case of fishes, special excretory tissues in the gill area.\nSome fishes (cartilaginous ones) do indeed maintain a high internal concentration of salts as part of their osmoregulatory mechanism:  it's not sodium chloride, however, but urea, and therefore their meat is stronger-tasting and has a salty smell.

God or Satan?,Satan doesn't have the power to create according to your religion. The bible says repeatedly that ONLY God has the power to create life. It is impossible for any christian to attribute a living organism to the doing of Satan >PERIOD<\n\nDiseases exist because ours is a random world and bacteria and viruses exist because of whatever reason. Perhaps they were created by an entity, perhaps they evolved. I believe that life may have evolved, and because I believe that I understand that many creatures exist whose sole purpose is to infect host bodies to survive, like many viruses. Do you honestly think a perfect and loving God created these viruses knowing what pain they cause and the fact that they most of them serve no purpose except to harm their hosts? Yeah......no one can quite convince me that he did because it would mean God isn't that kind. \n\nDo you believe God made disease? It is interesting to me that the bible says Jesus went around curing people of their diseases quite often. It seems to me that if Jesus really didn't like to see people suffer, as the bible leads us to believe, that he and his daddy just wouldn't have made disease causing agents when they supposedly created the world to START WITH, but there are so many flaws with the xtian way of thinking I just won't get into that. The question is this, if things happen for a reason, such as many xtians believe that you only get sick because god allows/wants it, why did Jesus go around curing those suffering? Was he not undoing their illness that they got in the first place because he and daddy allowed it in the first place? Deep, but go figure......it doesn't add up.\n\n Viruses are very interesting. They don't have all of the characteristics of living organisms. If you studied biology you might know that. They adopt to most things very well as do bateria and they do evolve ( It is a proven fact) to more deadly strains. That is why this Avian Flu is such a deadly strain. It hasn't always been around and it is very powerful. Do you think a god tweaked the virus so it would become even more deadly and powerful just to aggravate the human population on earth? The only other option is to accept that it just randomly evolved into what it is now, which is how scientists and rational people understand it.\n\nIf there is a God I can't explain some of the awful things he does if he does indeed control everything. I prescribe to Agnosticism, which means I am not so sure there is a god, so I don't have to make up excuses for the unfair and insidious way the world works and make biblegod look good at the same time like you poor xtians do.\n\nKeeping in with the christian viewpoint I am sure you hold, God made all living things, and that would have to include the virus and bacteria, therefore all illnesses caused by those organisms can be attributed to him.\n\nGod is such a nice dude if he is real.

__label__6 , Who in your opinion is Man Utd's dead cert to be signed in the summer?,There is alot of speculation out there, and i'm very interested in what other fans have to say on the summer transfer speculation and not the tabloids for a change. \n\nThere's strong rumour of Mattieu Bodmer from Lille and a slight possiblilty of Michael Ballack and Mahamadou Diarra to name a few. Seems like Chelsea will snap up most of our scouted players, stealing them beneath united's feet. Also there is Real Madrid rumoured to do their usual pre - season snap up of gunning every top player in the world and have bid for Liverpool's Steven Gerard. \n\nIn my opinion, some big names are going to be shipped between teams this summer. It's also my opinion that United need a HUGE name to sign with them to give the team a boost to carry them through next season if they are to keep up with Chelsea's pace and Arsenal's european conquistadors. \n\nOpinions please!,Rooney was saying how much he admires Riquelme and wants him to come to OT. Plus Fergie has been to watch him play, Villereal are rumoured to be OK to release him and Riquelme has said that he admires United's players - so I think he will come. He will be a great creative playmaking addition, but United still need a defensive midfielder, so they might go for Duscher. I think Diarra is off the list now though thanks to their greedy owner saying he will be more expensive than (the overpriced) Essien. Essien cost 24 million - I don't think United can pay that much.

__label__9 , how can men tell if a girl that is playing hard to get in love with him?,,My dear fellow, you can't.  Playing hard to get is emotional insurance for women.  If you respond favorably to them, then they will say, Yes, I liked you all along.  However, if you respond unfavorably, then they will say, What are you talking about, I wasn't giving off any signs, I don't like you, what are you talking about?  Emotional insurance...100% Coverage Plan if she becomes totally embarrassed.  If you suspect she is playing hard to get, just ask yourself if you are prepared to play her other little games even if you do get her because she just might be into heart games and not a mature way of dealing with love.

__label__4 , How do I avoid being penalized for earned income while starting college?,I own a home next to New Orleans that was not flooded by Hurricane Katrina and I want to sell it and move to Maryland to attend college.  I intend to rent a room from a friend for cheap until I graduate.  Meanwhile, I might be earning around 50K from this sale before taxes and fees.  How can I still qualify for financial aid with this lump sum?  Should I put it away in a CD or if I decided to buy more property where hurricanes do not exist and rent it out to someone cheap...without making a big stink about my not residing in that home so the gov. may not notice?  I intend to not work at all through my entire college career because if I let myself work I will FLUNK OUT!  I am an easily distracted student but I want to do this right this time!\n\nPLEASE HELP!,If you have already received your financial aid package, don't worry about anything.  Just act like nothing happened.\nAnd, if you have not received your financial aid package yet, don't run to tell the financial aid office that you are about to sell a house for 50K.\nThe only way I see that this could affect your financial aid is if you are heavily depending on federal loan/grants.  If you got or are going to get institutional grant/scholarship, you shouldn't worry about anything.
__label__7 , How much rent is a reasonable amount for my parents to request?,I'm 24, living at home and have just found a full time job after university and a while where I couldn't find anything. I'm earning around £150 a week. My parents have now started asking for rent. This is fair enough, of course, and I am more than willing to pay, but I want to be sure that they are asking for a fair amount. They have asked for £40 a week. I'm unsure of how long my job will last and have just started driving lessons, and so the money that doesn't go on rent is either being spent on the lessons or saved for lessons in the future.\n\nI am also hoping at some point to move out, and it would be nice to have as much money as possible to help me to do that. Originally, £40 a week sounded reasonable, but having spoken to several friends in a similar situation, I have found that despite my parents assurances that they are charging me much less than most parents do, they are in fact asking for 50-75% more than most people I know.\n\nHow much do/did other people pay/charge?,What is their financial situation? Who paid for your education? What would it cost you to live on your own. Does the 40 pounds include meals and laundry? There are a lot of questions you should consider. \n\nI suspect you can never repay them what you owe them so consider the 40 pounds a good deal and move on.
__label__10 , Does anyone realise that Democracy  and Islam just can't survive together? Inquiring minds want to Know?,,Islam can survive together with Democracy.

It doesn't matter if it is a Christian (Greece) or Islamic (Iran-Afghanistan) or Judaistic (Israel) theocracy.
__label__3 , Is what this good? Or am I doing.. ok?,I ran 1.05 miles today...yes I know you people that excersize all the time get like 5+ miles but hey I seriously started running last week and worked my way up making my distances longer...but today I wanted to get 1 mile in and I did...and yes I took breaks but I still ran one full mile yay me :) did I do good? Or was I ok? I'm 17 yrs old and I weigh 170 btw :) and no I'm not a fatty I just got the belly  but I've been doing 150 crunches every other day (lol),Most doctors, if not all, say exercise is good; however, by changing your eating habits, your weight (stomach) will go down and you could probably get away with doing alot less crunches (yuck!)  I ate more protein (chicken, fish), green veggies, lots of water, limited carbohydrates (go online or get a book) and continued running (not as much as you), and have kept my weight off and have done so since I had my twins 28 years ago.  Congrats on your commitment to running...it's cool to get that second wind and makes you feel like you could run forever and ever.  However, over the years (unfortunately it has been several), I have found that once you stop exercising, fat sure starts coming on quicker than if you hadn't exercised at all.  I picked Yoga and Pilates (bad back) and it has been quite successful.  You are 17 right now, get your body back by changing your eating habits and continuing to exercise (just don't get carried away if you know what I mean) and your weight and stomach will both start showing improvement more quickly than you could imagine.  The good news is that your skin is still able to bounce back and hopefully you will avoid those awful stretchmarks.  Like I said previously, I had twins at 22, went over 200 lbs when I delivered, and can honestly say I do not have any stretchmarks, do not eat diet or no fat foods (again, yuck!) and my body looks pretty good for being in my 50's.  Another word of caution....understand the meaning of MODERATION.  It's all part of the life cycle.  Good Luck.
__label__8 , will eric littman be back in BIG BROTHER ALL STARS??,will eric littman the firefighter from las vegas nevada be coming back to big brother all stars???...we'll just have to wait and see..eric was evicted from the bb6 house back in 2005 and was a my personal favorite from all the seasons..we'll talk more about THE MAN in a little bit but first lets find out and see if he'll be back..we'll keep our fingers crossed...YOU DA MAN ERIC!!!!!,I think there is basically no way Eric will be back for BBAS.  He has very little public support, and the premise of all stars is half of the players are voted in by the public, half put in by the producers.  On the male side for the public vote, it will likely be Evil Dr. Will, Kaysar, and Howie... mainly because the latter two are fresh on the public mind.  Cappy has a lot of competition to be put in by the producers, and there's been a lot more blown up personalities from other seasons that tend to be more of a star on their own series.  But hey, it would be cool if Cappy is on.  Could be a good addition to the Good vs. Evil theme they have this year.  Cheers!

__label__4 , What do you do about bulling at a public school?,My son has been dealing with this bully for 3 years, the parents do nothing, the school does nothing. We just had a bad incident happen a couple of days ago where my son who just got his cast off 6 days earlier, got hurt by same kid and probably broken it again. The school says that there were no witnesses, therefore theres nothing they can do.,I think that the administration at your son's school should want take bullying much more seriusly. With all of the school shootings in the last couple of years, I don't know why they would want something like this to go unresolved. I would remind the administration of what happened at Columbine. If they don't want the same thing to happen at their school and it easily could, no school is safe! You may want to share with them the play Bang Bang You're Dead. It is a play dedicated to ending school violence. Your son's school needs to get its students active AGAINST school violence. There should be zero tolerance for it!! Having the students put on this play could be a start to the education process. Also seek out other parents to go to the administration and take a stand. Contact the Parent Teacher Organization and educate them. They are not going to want to have their child potentially put in danger.

__label__1 , When a witch dies, does her descendants inherit any of her paranormal abilities?,My grandmother was the leader of a coven way back in the 30's. She died 14 years before I was born. As a teenager, I saw things and heard things that nobody else could. I also woke up one night to find a brilliant ball of light floating outside of a window. It passed through the window and landed on top of my wardrobe. The light was extremely white and bright, yet the glow from it was no more than 5 inches away from it. The wardrobe made sounds as if breaking under the weight of the light. A short time later the light floated out in the direction it came in through the window. Needless to say, I was very frightened by the light, but I felt that it was trying to contact me. It may have been my grandmother trying to reach me. Is she the reason for my past experiences?,According to the 10 commandments (Exodus 20) spoken by the LORD God (Yahweh Elohim), the iniquities (idolatries, adulteries, etc...) are passed on to the 3rd & 4th generation of those who hate God.  The blessings go onto the 1000s generations of those who love God.

__label__3 , What are COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors?,,cyclooxygenase (COX)\ncyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)\n\nCox-1: Cyclooxygenase-1, a protein that acts as an enzyme to speed up the production of certain chemical messengers, called prostaglandins, within the stomach. The prostaglandins work within certain cells that are responsible for inflammation and other functions. For example, they promote the production of the natural mucus lining that protects the inner stomach. Cox-1 is normally present in a variety of areas of the body, including not only the stomach but any other site of inflammation.\n\n\nCox-2 inhibitor: A type of drug that selectively blocks the enzyme cox-2 (cyclooxygenase-2). Blocking this enzyme impedes the production of the chemical messengers called prostaglandins that cause the pain and swelling of arthritis inflammation. Cox-2 inhibitors may not pose as great a risk of injuring the stomach or intestines as cox-1 inhibitors. Cox-2 inhibitors now on the market include celecoxib (brand name: Celebrex) and rofecoxib (brand name: Vioxx).

__label__1 , Do demons have the ability to hurt us?,Isn't it said in the Bible that God has to grant evil beings (specifically Satan in the passaeg I'm thinking of) permission to hurt or torment us?,When one complies with the counsel of God's Word regarding spiritism, you spurn the bait of the demons. (Compare Psalm 141:9,10; Romans 12:9.) Does this mean that wicked spirits will stop trying to capture you? By no means! After tempting Jesus three times, Satan (the chief of the demons) retired from him until another convenient time.\nLuke 4:13) Similarly, obstinate spirits not only ATTRACT people but also ATTACK them.\n\n\nRecall Satan's attack on God's servant Job.  The Devil caused the loss of his livestock and the death of most of his servants.  Satan even killed Job's children. Next, he struck Job himself with a painful disease.  But Job kept his integrity to God and was greatly blessed.  (Job 1:7-19; chap. 2:7,8 & chap 42:12) Since then, the demons have made some people speechless or blind and have continued to revel in the suffering of humans.  (Matthew 9:32,33; 12:22; Mark 5:2-5) Today, reports show that demons sexually harass some and drive others to insanity.  They incite still others to murder and suicide, which are sins against God. (Deuteronomy 5:17; 1 John 3:15) Nonetheless, thousands of people once ensnared by these wicked spirits have been able to break free.  How has this been possible for them? They have done so by taking these vital steps. Even  if you have not practiced spiritism , get rid of anytghing having spiritistic uses or overtones.  This includes books, magazines, videos, posters, musical recordings and objects used for spiritistic purposes. Also included are idols, amulets and other items worn for protection and gifts received from practicers of spiritism. (Deuteronomy 78:25,26; 1 Corinthians 10:21). We can be successful in our spiritual warfare against the Devil and the demons under his direction.  There is no reason to quake in fear of Satan, for the disciple James wrote: SUBJECT YUOURSELVES...TO GOD; BUT OPPOSE THE DEVIL, AND HE WILL FLEE FROM YOU.  James 4:7. So go on the offensive in opposing Satan by having nothing to do with occult or magical practices and those indulging in them.  \nThe Scriptures clearly show that servants of God must refuse to look for omens or to engage in astrology (horoscrope reading included) divination, etc.  If we are spiritually active and strong in true worship we need not be afraid that someone will cast a spell on us.  Numbers 23:23; Deuteronomy 18:10-12; Isaiah 47:12-15; Acts 19:18-20. \n\nFirst century Christians in Ephesis who had practiced spiritism before becoming believers took positive steps.  We read that quite a number of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them up before everybody. (Acts 19:19)\n\nWe know that the Devil fled when Jesus resisted his attack by using the Scriptures during the temptation in the wilderness. (Matthew 4:4,7,10, 11. Putting on the complete suit of God-given spiritual armor makes a difference.
__label__9 , Matrimonial name changes...?,I find this tradition really offensive.  Women say they want to change their name to show commitment to their husbands.  But what about their husband's commitment?  Shouldn't they change their name too?\n\nPlease, I'd like to know why this tradition continues and how come more women aren't pissed off that this is expected from them?,I didn't change my name when I married, because I do think it's outdated.  We have two children who have my husband's last name.  What I find offensive is when they try to give you the first name, too, as in Mrs. John Smith. For heavens' sake.  \nI don't know why this tradition has continued, but it is difficult to find a solution that is concise and clear.  Either you have to explain and defend having a different name, or you have to adopt both, which gets pretty cumbersome.
__label__3 , what can i do to ease symptoms of vicodin withdrawal, without involving a doctor?,i want to jump out of my skin and can't sit still for a moment.  can i do something to calm down?,Painkillers can become severely habit forming, especially if you have been taking them for an extended period of time. It can be difficult to stop taking them without experiencing physical or psychological withdrawl. There are some things you can do to lessen the effects however.\n\n1.) You might want to consider speaking with your physician if you feel you have a problem, There are several medications that can lessen withdrawl symptoms. But you want to avoid the doctor, so maybe you could try these ideas.\n\n2.) You can try to wean yourself off of the pills slowly, reducing your dosage gradually or increase the time period between doses. This will be a process that takes place over time. You will still have to take the pills, and it could be a while before you get off of them, but you won't crack up from withdrawl!\n\n3.) You may want to consider meditation or other pain management techniques to reduce your dependence on painkillers and increase your willpower. \n\n4.) You could try another medication, something to help with calmness or nervousness. There are several herbal remedies you could try. Check out your local GNC for some hep if you want to avoid the doctor.

__label__7 , renting a flat in spain?,i'm an english teacher looking to work in spain and have heard that the prices of rents are fairly expensive. i am particularly interested in the city of san sebastian but any other info would be great. since i don't live there yet to know what money is worth there, the most useful way would be if you could tell me the price of a decent (but not lavish) downtown flat for a month in relation to an avarege monthly salary. e.g. my current flat costs about a third of a normal language teacher's salary. thanks.,Most of Europe quotes in Euro - many web sites and bank can give you the current conversion rate (last I checked it was around 1.20 to 1.25 to US currency).\n\nI recently did extensively research on apartments and flats for a vacation and found that an internet search brings up TONS of websites that you can browse.  You can get a real feel for the layouts, styles, and many even show you where it is on a map!  \n\nAlso, you can go to a local bookstore and look at travel books and many of them list recommended web sites on renting -- even though this is mostly geared to short-term stays, many of the companies do long-term rentals as well.  THis is also a great resourse as many of these travel books will also give you tips on renting, why they like certain companies and the such.\n\nOnce thing I learned from my research is to pay very close attention to the rental terms, what is and is not included, deposit terms, additional agency fees for finding the apt/flat, etc.,  \n\nGood luck and I hope you find something you like!

__label__1 , How  should i deal with the people around me?it seems difficult to satisfy people& myself&God all together!!!?,,There is no way that you will ever be able to satisfy 100% of the people 100% of the time. You have to look at your beliefs and your ethics and values. Usually listening to the inner voice is a huge key. One thing that I have learned is to breathe - I know that this sounds silly, but it does work. The fact that you are able to stop your emotional flow to take a minute to focus on inhaling and exhaling allows your logical side to have control, even if it's just long enough for a breath. Physically, the inhalation of air will feed your brain cells. You will be less likely to overreact. \n\nYou will be happier with yourself if you do take a moment. You will be able to react in a way more in tune with your beliefs, and the difficult person may not be as bothersome.\n\nAnother thing I have always lived by is LEAPS\n  L      Listen\n  E      Empathize\n  A      Apologize\n  P      Positive Phrasing\n  S      Solution\n\nListen - to what the person is saying - sometimes all they need is to say what their issue is.\n\nEmpathize - No one has a situation that is so far removed from the norm that someone else can not relate to it. \n\nApologize - Chicago was right - sometimes it really is hard to say I'm sorry, but it is totally worth it.  And look at it this way, even if you are not sorry for what happened, you are sorry that it has caused a negative reaction.\n\nPositive Phrasing - Quote the Beatles (can ya'll tell I was a music major yet???  LOL)  We can work it out!  Every problem has a solution. It may be that the difficult person and you have no more interaction, but it is solved.\n\nSolution - Look at the root and discuss an option for solution. \n\nMost problems are not really issues, they are lacks of communications. People don't listen anymore and we as a society have learned to that it's not worth the time to communicate; because our heart felt emotions fall on deaf ears when we try.  Be committed to listening.\n\nI hope this helps - e-mail me and let me know!\n\nLeigh-lee
__label__10 , what is japanese's constitution day?,,Constitution Memorial Day (Japanese: 憲法記念日, Kenpō Kinen-bi) is a national holiday in Japan. It takes place on May 3 in celebration of the promulgation of the 1947 Constitution of Japan. It is a part of the collection of holidays known as Golden Week.[1]\n\nA holiday since the current Japanese constitution came into effect on May 3, 1947, this is the only day of the year that the National Diet Building (国会議事堂, kokkai-gijidō) is open to the public.[2] Being a day that draws its significance from the Japanese constitution, Constitution Memorial Day is often chosen as a day to reflect on the meaning of democracy and Japanese government. For instance, in 2003, a number of newspapers featured editorials regarding the constitution's embattled Article 9.[3]

__label__1 , Is he showing signs ??,Me and my boyfriend split up about a week ago and lately we have been talking. He keeps on saying things like in time we will see if our relationship will work out and doing other things that signify that maybe we will get back together. For instance, last night I was sick and went to bed early and he called and told me to call him first thing after breakfast tommorow and let him know Im okay. Also he is turning his basement into an apartment (his family lives with him) which is something that he was planning to do for me so Im not around the cats (Im allergic). Part of me really wants to be with him again, but another part doesnt want to deal the drama that came with our relationship. But I'd live with it just to be with him. My question is : Is he really showing signs of wanting an reconciliation or am I just imagining signs because of my own hopes?,I hate to say it, really, but it sounds like he is either hedging his bets or letting you down easy. If you want to be back with him you need to be slightly aloof and let him know you have options. I'm normally not into playing games, but there is nothing that will drive him away faster than being needy or bring him around faster than seeing that you can live - well - without him. Be nice, but not too available. Also, I don't know why you split, but unless you work through those issues they will still be there even if you do reconcile. I strongly urge counseling - whether you go back with him or not. Even if you don't it will help you in your next relationship. Good luck!

__label__5 , Help with comment box on my website?,Hello,\nI got a free template from the internet, and on the 'contacts' page it came with a sort of comment section. But it's not linked to anything. You can see what I mean at my website: http://www.lilypop.net/contact\nUnder the contact information, how do I get that to work? At the moment, if you click 'send' nothing happens.\nCheers in advance!\nAisha,in order for your contacts to work....\n\nwe need to pay attention to this line:\n\n<form id=contact action= method=post onsubmit=return configForm(this); style=position: relative; z-index: 1;>\n\nYour form does not have the configForm() function neither do you import any javascript files so return configForm() is not really necessary....\n\nYour action=....\nWhen you click the submit button of an HTML form... The form's action attribute defines the name of the file to send the content to. The file defined in the action attribute usually does something with the received input. It is normally a server side script e.g. asp, php, perl, etc which processes the users details.\n\nWhether or not you can use a server side scripting language depends on your host. Since you are hosting with yahoo... you might need to check your whether your hosting package allows. Another method is to make the form submit to an email addres but this normally opens the site visitors email client so it is not desirable. check out:\n\nhttp://w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp\nhttp://w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_form_mail\n\nPS: I like your site design...

__label__10 , PANCHA, I usually don't do this, but.........?,Could you answer these questions for me:\n1) How should  America solve the illegal immigrant problem?\n2) Is illegal immigration fair for immigrants who had to wait years in their country to get American citizenship or papers to LEGALLY come to the United States?\n3)Why do you constantly resist the notion that Mexican illegal immigrants come to America legally?\n\nI'm curious because so many people are against illegal immigration and you are often on the opposing side. But, you have never articulated an alternative to going the process to become a legal citizen or permanent resident.,Ok,I HAVE said in previous posts that there should be better border security.More agents,camaera's,whatever DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.\nThe only way I can see to solve the current problem with the illegal immigrants is to give them amnesty.And I agree,it is unfair to ppl who have been waiting to come in legally.And I was called all kinds of names when I suggested they be able to come too.And as far as resisting the notion that they come in legally I know some come legally.And another thing I get alot is that I am only for the Mexicans.That's not true.I want ALL to get amnesty.

__label__4 , How do you develop critical thinking skills?,,There are lots of books on critical thinking. If you are asking this on behalf of a child, start out easy, and buy critical thinking work books, like 1st grade, and work his/her way up.

Buy more than just one book, so you can develop more and more sides of the skill. .Buy an SAT prep book from the College Board, (about $17) and read the critical reading sections. Answer the questions after. You'll get better at reading critically as you do it more.\n\nHope this helps!

__label__4 , what is an encyclopaedia?,,Encyclopedia or Encyclopaedia, reference work that provides information on a range of subjects. Encyclopedias can encompass many areas of interest, or they can focus on a particular field of study, such as a geographic area, an ethnic group, a time period, or an academic discipline. Most encyclopedias have hundreds or thousands of articles, each addressing a distinct topic. Many of the articles contain illustrations, maps, photographs, and other media elements that help readers understand concepts. For centuries encyclopedias were published as multivolume sets of books, but in the late 20th century they appeared in new formats, such as CD-ROM, digital video disc (DVD), and on the Internet. \n\nThe term encyclopedia comes from the Greek words enkyklios paideia, meaning “comprehensive education” and originally signifying instruction in all branches of knowledge, or a comprehensive education in a specific subject. This concept gave rise to the idea of collecting the materials for such instruction into a single work, in which the contents and relations of the various arts and sciences would be explained systematically. Attempts to produce books of this kind were made more than 2,000 years ago, although the name encyclopedia was not given to such works until the 16th century.
__label__6 , who should i draft 1st in fantasy baseball?,baseball, fanatsy sports,,Depends on the setup of the league - what stats are they counting, what is the draft like?\nBoth players put up similar numbers, with Pujols on one hand consistently having more doubles and fewer strikeouts, and on the other, consistently getting a few less RBI's, HR, and SB than Rodriguez.\nThere will probably be fewer RBI chances on the Cardinals than the Yankees, but Pujols is younger and is just entering his prime rather than perching on the tail end of it.\nAnother factor: there are fewer impact 3B than there are impact 1B.  In a six-team league, take Pujols. In a 12+ team, you might want to grab the best player at a somewhat difficult position to fill in ARod.

I take care of my 87-year old father.\n\nI have torn the rotator cuffs of both my shoulders and a surgeon says , after an MRI, that I need surgeries--two of them, left first, right later.\n\nRight now, I am mildly inhibited only. I can still bathe, dress, and do basic household tasks. I even pull the start cord for my dad to mow the lawn.\n\nBut I cannot push even pillows or clothing up onto a shelf above my head in the closet. And I have mild difficulty in putting clothes out to dry on a clothesline.\n\nI know that all surgery is risky.\nI am a recoering alcoholic, too, so I hesitate to go under general \nanesthesia. I also hesitate to have to wear slings or cats on my arms for weeks or months, temporarily becoming more disabled.\n\nWhat do you think? If you are an M.D., great, please respond. Or, if you have had this type of surgery and wish to report your results with it, I'd like to hear from you. \nNo abuse!!,funny you should ask...i just had arthoscopic surgery done last friday...in much the same way that they would do the rotator cuff...mine was dislocated and they fixed the cartilidge to prevent it from happening again...\n\nit's a big decission - but not that the surgery is over, i'm so glad i did it...\n\ni was in much of the same situation as you were...limited mobility....above my head...but, was still healing from the dislocation...\n\ni have minimal pain - and today being 4 days after, haven't takenthe pain meds at all...my mobility is pretty good...i do have a sling, and will have to do some physical therapy in a week or so, but the doc tells me that after that my mobility should be back to almost normal.....\n\nsling is only going to be on for about 10-14 days...\n\ni work as a counselor for people in 12-step programs - i'm assuming that your fear is for the drugs afterwards?  i;m sure if you spoke with the surgeon he could figure something out...don't use it as an excuse.....\n\nanyway...not sure if i helped or not...in my opinion the surgery isn't as bad as i expected it to be....and only 4 days later it is already feeling ok...\n\ni'm only 32 and didn't want to feel disabled the rest of my life - reaching the top shelf...washing my hair, etc...\n\ngood luck with your decission....
__label__3 , In what way do cigarettes and caffiene effect metabolism?,,Well they get my butt going in the morning.\n\nNicotine is a complex drug.  If you need to be up it will help you pick up and if you need to relax it helps you relax.  \nBasically it magnifies the feelings and emotions that you are trying to get.\n\nCaffine is a stimulant and diuretic so if it doesn't get you going mentally it will get you going pee wise.\n\nThe combination of the nicotine and caffine are real morning starters, that jump start a person and get them going faster.\n\nMetabolically I would guess it would speed up that as well since it seems to be the same effect on every other system.

__label__10 , Will The Democratic Party Regain Control of Congress?,Or Will They Only Win 1 Chamber?\nOr Will The Republican Party Still Retain Control?\nIf, you think the Democrats will win control of 1 chamber, which 1 is it going to be? The Senate or The House?,Will The Democratic Party Regain Control of Congress?\nOr Will They Only Win 1 Chamber?\n\nIt's my opinion unless a miracle happens the best they can hope for would be the House. I don't think they will pull off a sweep like the Republicans did in 1994. I'm still amazed that happened.\n\nOr Will The Republican Party Still Retain Control?\n\nThis would be my guess. Republicans don't lose either House of Senate. Off year elections are about state races. Do you like your person or not. President's popularity has little effect.\n\nIf, you think the Democrats will win control of 1 chamber, which 1 is it going to be? The Senate or The House? \n\nIF the Democrats win one house it will be The House. There all 435 seats are up for re-election. In the Senate there are only 33 maybe 34 seats up for re-election. Democrats would have to win a greater percentage of the races in order to retake the Senate.\n\nNancy Pelosi Speaker of the House..\nHarry Reid Senate Majority Leader..\nDoes it have a nice ring to it?\n\nI'm a moderate. I'm not rabid for either side. Harry whould be OK if he goes a little less combative. Nancy? The thought of her really being in charge of anything of importance makes me nauseous.\n\nRemember I'm one of those people who really determine who's running this country. I'm not a Republican or a Democrat. In 1994 the Democrats got kicked out because the swing voters were tired of what the liberals were pushing AND what the Republicans were advocating seemed like a good alternative.\n\nUs swingers may be tired of what the Republicans are pushing, but Democrats aren't offering anything as an alternative but 'We aren't Republicans'. That doesn't resonate with me. Talk to me. Tell me what you really want to do and how you plan to pay for it. \n\nThat how you plan to pay for it is the most important part of what I want to know. Especialy since Democrats have gotten on the 'We're spending too much' bandwagon lately.\n\nCongress IS there for the taking. But if you want my vote I'm going to have to like what I'm hearing. And if all I'm hearing is the Republicans are wrong. That may be true but if Democrats don't tell me how they are going to do differently, how do I know they won't be worse?

__label__6 , What mountain is the highest for skiing in British Columbia. And is it taller than Vermount and Montreals hill,,Whistler has the highest vertical (5200 feet), and I believe Kicking horse is the highest at +8000 feet.  Sunshine, which sits on the border between BC and AB, is at 9000 feet.

__label__2 , Really confused???? I don't know where to start?,A 1.00-kg object is attached to a horizontal spring. The spring is initially stretched by 0.100 m, and the object is released from rest there.  It proceeds to move without friction. The next time the speed of the object is zero is 0.500 s later.  What is the maximum speed of the object,Okay, this is an example of simple harmonic motion (SHM).If the velocity is zero after 0.5s, this means the period of oscillation (T) is 2x0.5s = 1.0sec. If the initial displacement is 0.1m, then the amplitude of oscillation (A) is 2x0.1m = 0.2m. The maximum speed of the object will be achieved when the displacement is 0. The equation for the displacement for SHM is:\n\ny = Asin(2pift + pi/2) where A is the amplitude, f is the frequency = 1/T and disp = initial displacement, and t = time.\n\nSo the velocity is given by the time derivative of displacement:\n\nv = Acos(2pift + pi/2) = 0.2cos(2pit + pi/2)\n\nNow, since the maximum velocity is achieved after 0.25s (the max velocity is when the object passes through the origin which will be after half the time taken to reach the other end of the cycle);\n\nv = 0.2cos(pi/2 + pi/2) = 0.2cos pi = -0.2m/s\n\nqed

Every couple of minutes someone wants to whine about the bible or god or whatever they can find to whine about. If they have such a problem with it then just convert and shut up already. Has anyone else noticed this or am I the only one?????????,***I agree.***\nOr they can not listen, if they wish.\n\nThe reason why they complain is because Jesus message is the TRUTH and the TRUTH is a painful medicine to take if your a sinner. \n\nThey hear the word of God and it stirs something inside their hearts, something so powerful that it angers them. If  they repent their sins, and give it over to the Lord Jesus Christ, they will replace that anger, sin and hate with LOVE, JOY and FORGIVENESS. \n\nThey will be filled with the loving gift of the Holy spirit and they will be given the awsome gift of salvation. They will be free to spend an eternity in heaven by accepting Jesus Christ.

__label__1 , Why does the word funeral begin with fun?,,The pain of the loss allows emotion to pivot like a balancing, we remember the departed for the good times shared and in this remembrance the joy of those moments are brought out. The lost for some however can be so overwhelming that they can't stop mourning at this point in their grief, which is quite understandable if you've ever experienced the loss of one held so dear. The fun in funeral is a coincidence(although in my culture they have what is called a wake where little sandwiches are served with tasty beverages), and mourning has nothing to do with morning; but the coincidence allows for the thought that for the bereaved a new day will come, with the dawn bringing light back into the darkness that fills their hearts, or at least that is my hope. Great question, thank you for asking it.

__label__1 , What the heck is Canada's Boxing Day??,,There is great dispute over the true origins of Boxing Day. The more common stories include:\n\nCenturies ago, merchants would present their servants food and fruits as a form of Yuletide tip. Naturally, the gifts of food and fruit were packed in boxes, hence the term Boxing Day. \nIn feudal times, Christmas was a reason for a gathering of extended families. All the serfs would gather their families in the manor of their lord, which made it easier for the lord of the estate to hand out annual stipends to the serfs. After all the Christmas parties on December 26, the lord of the estate would give practical goods such as cloth, grains, and tools to the serfs who lived on his land. Each family would get a box full of such goods the day after Christmas. Under this explanation, there was nothing voluntary about this transaction; the lord of the manor was obliged to supply these goods. Because of the boxes being given out, the day was called Boxing Day. \nIn Britain many years ago, it was common practice for the servants to carry boxes to their employers when they arrived for their day's work on the day after Christmas (December 25). Their employers would then put coins in the boxes as special end-of-year gifts. This can be compared with the modern day concept of Christmas bonuses. The servants carried boxes for the coins, hence the name Boxing Day. \nIn churches, it was traditional to open the church's donation box on Christmas day, and the money in the donation box was to be distributed to the poorer or lower class citizens on the next day. In this case, the box in Boxing Day comes from that one gigantic lockbox in which the donations were left. \nIn Britain because many servants had to work for their employers on Christmas day they would instead open their presents (i.e., boxes) the next day, which therefore became known as Boxing Day.

__label__8 , Why is Britney Spears partying so much when she's got two little ones to care for?,,It's very simple. She cares more about partying than she does about her children. She can say whatever she likes--that they mean the world to her. That they are the most important thing in her life. That she would do anything for them. Anything that doesn't interfere with her partying, obviously. That's where she has drawn the line. Behaviour is more indicative of what one feels and believes  than what comes out of their mouths.\n\nLeaving kids with a trusted babysitter is sometimes necessary, but each instance carries some risk. And the more frequently you leave them in somebody else's hands, the greater the chance for something untoward to happen to them. \n\nOn second thought, in some people's cases, their kids may be safer in other people's care. This may be true for Spears. Either way, She's probably not on the short list for Mother of the Year.
__label__2 , Which are of the characteristicsof rubber to metal bonding?,necesito informaciobn sobre la adhbesion entre caucho y metal,Three essential elements form the core of the bonding process, the rubber, the bonding agents and the substrate, figure 1. The selection of the polymer base and the associated compound depends mainly on the product specification. Provided that the rubber can flow into the mould without developing a significant level of cross-linking (less than 2%), a bond can be formed using any rubber compound. There are no restrictions on the use of particular compounding ingredients, although it is best to avoid substances that will bleed rapidly to the surface of the uncured stock. The rubber Compounder therefore needs to concentrate attention to matching the physical requirements of the cured rubber and the processing needs of the moulding process.

However last month she fell down and fractured her hip and now she has to be in a wheelchair. The staff think she has gone past the type of care that they offer at assited living and she needs more of a 1 on 1 nursing home to tend to her. \nShe is very stubborn and hates the fact she has to be in assited living to beguin with, she thinks she is the temproraily and will be back to her old life pre-stroke but this is untrue.  One time I accidently asked how her nursing home is and she got angry and said don't ever cal lit that and hung up on me. \n\nHow do I let her know that we need to move her to this new place.. She is not going to take it well.,I really feel for you, this is a very hard thing to go through.  My family went through the same experience last year with my grandmother.  \n\nMy grandmother had cancer and it basically debilated her. She was unable to walk or do any of her daily living activities.  \n\n\nYou can try to explain to your grandmother that you can no longer provide the care for her that she requires and tell her that you are doing so because you love her and want her to have the proper care and just hope that she will understand.  This will most likely be one of the hardest things you've ever done, but you are doing the right thing knowing she will have the care she needs. \n\nGood Luck and God Bless.\n\nP.S.  I think some of these answers are pretty harsh.  It is a very hard decision and people don't really understand unless they have lived through it with a loved one.   There are situations when we just are not  physically capable of giving the proper care to a person with sickness or illness.  Try not to let some of the responses discourage you.

We continue to receive reports that terrorists are planning attacks against Western interests in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Commercial and public areas frequented by foreigners are possible terrorist targets.   \nLINK\nhttp://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/opinion/orl-thomas21_106feb21,0,2383510.story\n\nI am thinking yes.  \nThe money used to fund the 9/11 attacks, most of it,  \nwas sent to the hijackers through the UAE banking system. The UAE stonewalled U.S. efforts to track  \nal Qaeda bank accounts after 9/11. In addition, the Emirates does not recognize Israel. And the UAE was a  \ntransfer point for shipments of nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya. And if those aren't good  \nenough reasons, I would just suggest I'm at a complete loss to offer what might be considered good reasons.  \n      -- Lou Dobbs,  CNN

__label__8 , Does the jazz group The Jazzmasters ever go on tour?,The group is also known by their leader, Paul Hardcastle.,The Jazzmasters do not go on tour anymore - havent recorded an album since the 90's\nPaul Hardcastle released some albums as the Jazzmasters in the '90s in addition to his normal output. The Jazzmasters moniker is somewhat misleading — the Jazzmasters are essentially a Hardcastle solo project featuring vocalist Helen Rogers as well as the occasional contributor like reedist Phil Todd. The first Jazzmasters album appeared in 1991, with subsequent albums coming every few years. The Jazzmasters albums explore more electronic sounds than Hardcastle's traditional output; it's not strictly dance music, but is quite lively and seemingly trendy for contemporary jazz music. The albums sold very well; however, critics were less than impressed.

__label__4 , Metal rusts the most where?and rusts the least where.?,Im kinda wondering...like cause metal stuff in my house is rusting everywhere and i like to know more about it...i mean im pwetty stupid on that.And if you can,please give websites on it,Metal only needs one thing to rust, oxygen.  Water and salt are catalyst, but really it's metal oxidizing.

__label__1 , Is it wrong to Pray to Jesus to strike down a sinner?,Im only trying to help them get their just rewards!!!,Well, I think that it’s primitive, but you can pray that if you want.  It won’t matter.  I know that not all Christians think this way, but this is the reason so many people think that Christianity is a angry, hateful religion; it’s always about punishing the “sinners” and people who think differently and rewarding the good Christians.  Of course if you are talking about something really bad that the person did (like murder, rape, etc.), then I do think it is normal and healthy to be angry about that.  Instead of praying about it, actually do something that will make a difference.
